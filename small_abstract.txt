"An old conjecture of Ringel states that every tree with $m$ edges decomposes the complete graph $K_{2m+1}$. The best known lower bound for the order of a complete graph which admits a decomposition by every given tree with $m$ edges is $O(m^3)$. We show that asymptotically almost surely a random tree with $m$ edges and $p=2m+1$ a prime decomposes $K_{2m+1}(r)$ for every $r\ge 2$, the graph obtained from the complete graph $K_{2m+1}$ by replacing each vertex by a coclique of order $r$. Based on this result we show, among other results, that a random tree with $m+1$ edges a.a.s. decomposes the compete graph $K_{6m+5}$ minus one edge. "
"We consider a scenario in which a database stores sensitive data of users and an analyst wants to estimate statistics of the data. The users may suffer a cost when their data are used in which case they should be compensated. The analyst wishes to get an accurate estimate, while the users want to maximize their utility. We want to design a mechanism that can estimate statistics accurately without compromising users' privacy. Since users' costs and sensitive data may be correlated, it is important to protect the privacy of both data and cost. We model this correlation by assuming that a user's unknown sensitive data determines a distribution from a set of publicly known distributions and a user's cost is drawn from that distribution. We propose a stronger model of privacy preserving mechanism where users are compensated whenever they reveal information about their data to the mechanism. In this model, we design a Bayesian incentive compatible and privacy preserving mechanism that guarantees accuracy and protects the privacy of both cost and data. "
"We study the existence of simple closed geodesics on most (in the sense of Baire category) Alexandrov surfaces with curvature bounded below, compact and without boundary. We show that it depends on both the curvature bound and the topology of the surfaces. "
"In this paper we derive an extra class of non-Markovian master equations where the system state is written as a sum of auxiliary matrixes whose evolution involve Lindblad contributions with local coupling between all of them, resembling the structure of a classical rate equation. The system dynamics may develops strong non-local effects such as the dependence of the stationary properties with the system initialization. These equations are derived from alternative microscopic interactions, such as complex environments described in a generalized Born-Markov approximation and tripartite system-environment interactions, where extra unobserved degrees of freedom mediates the entanglement between the system and a Markovian reservoir. Conditions that guarantees the completely positive condition of the solution map are found. Quantum stochastic processes that recover the system dynamics in average are formulated. We exemplify our results by analyzing the dynamical action of non-trivial structured dephasing and depolarizing reservoirs over a single qubit. "
"I review how traditional grand unified theories, which require adjoint (or higher representation) Higgs fields for breaking to the standard model, can be contained within string theory. The status (as of January 1996) of the search for stringy free fermionic three generation SO(10) SUSY--GUT models is discussed. Progress in free fermionic classification of both SO(10)$_2$ charged and uncharged embeddings and in $N=1$ spacetime solutions is presented. Based on talks presented at the Workshop on SUSY Phenomena and SUSY GUTs, Santa Barbara, California, Dec. 7-11, 1995, and at the Orbis Scientiae, Coral Gables, Florida, January 25-28, 1996. Appearing in the Proceedings of Orbis Scientiae, 1996. "
"Consider a monotone Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ and the canonical monotone coupling $\{\eta_p:p\in[0,1]\}$ of an element in $\{0,1\}^n$ chosen according to product measure with intensity $p\in[0,1]$. The random point $p\in[0,1]$ where $f(\eta_p)$ flips from $0$ to $1$ is often concentrated near a particular point, thus exhibiting a threshold phenomenon. For a sequence of such Boolean functions, we peer closely into this threshold window and consider, for large $n$, the limiting distribution (properly normalized to be nondegenerate) of this random point where the Boolean function switches from being 0 to 1. We determine this distribution for a number of the Boolean functions which are typically studied and pay particular attention to the functions corresponding to iterated majority and percolation crossings. It turns out that these limiting distributions have quite varying behavior. In fact, we show that any nondegenerate probability measure on $\mathbb{R}$ arises in this way for some sequence of Boolean functions. "
"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 31P and 51V nuclei has been measured in a spin-1/2 alternating-chain compound (VO)_2P_2O_7. By analyzing the temperature variation of the 31P NMR spectra, we have found that (VO)_2P_2O_7 has two independent spin components with different spin-gap energies. The spin gaps are determined from the temperature dependence of the shifts at 31P and 51V sites to be 35 K and 68 K, which are in excellent agreement with those observed in the recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments [A.W. Garrett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 745 (1997)]. This suggests that (VO)_2P_2O_7 is composed of two magnetic subsystems showing distinct magnetic excitations, which are associated with the two crystallographically-inequivalent V chains running along the b axis. The difference of the spin-gap energies between the chains is attributed to the small differences in the V-V distances, which may result in the different exchange alternation in each magnetic chain. The exchange interactions in each alternating chain are estimated and are discussed based on the empirical relation between the exchange interaction and the interatomic distance. "
"We have obtained spectra of 163 quasars at $z_\mathrm{em}>4.4$ with the Gemini Multi Object Spectrometers on the Gemini North and South telescopes, the largest publicly available sample of high-quality, low-resolution spectra at these redshifts. From this homogeneous data set, we generated stacked quasar spectra in three redshift intervals at $z\sim 5$. We have modelled the flux below the rest-frame Lyman limit ($\lambda_\mathrm{r}<912$\AA) to assess the mean free path $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ of the intergalactic medium to HI-ionizing radiation. At mean redshifts $z_\mathrm{q}=4.56$, 4.86 and 5.16, we measure $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}=(22.2\pm 2.3, 15.1\pm 1.8, 10.3\pm 1.6)h_{70}^{-1}$ proper Mpc with uncertainties dominated by sample variance. Combining our results with $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ measurements from lower redshifts, the data are well modelled by a simple power-law $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}=A[(1+z)/5]^\eta$ with $A=(37\pm 2)h_{70}^{-1}$ Mpc and $\eta = -5.4\pm 0.4$ between $z=2.3$ and $z=5.5$. This rapid evolution requires a physical mechanism -- beyond cosmological expansion -- which reduces the cosmic effective Lyman limit opacity. We speculate that the majority of HI Lyman limit opacity manifests in gas outside galactic dark matter haloes, tracing large-scale structures (e.g. filaments) whose average density (and consequently neutral fraction) decreases with cosmic time. Our measurements of the strongly redshift-dependent mean free path shortly after the completion of HI reionization serve as a valuable boundary condition for numerical models thereof. Having measured $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}\approx 10$ Mpc at $z=5.2$, we confirm that the intergalactic medium is highly ionized by that epoch and that the redshift evolution of the mean free path does not show a break that would indicate a recent end to HI reionization. "
"Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we perform the first systematic study for the ground-state three-quark (3Q) potential $V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm g.s.}$ and the 1st excited-state 3Q potential $V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm e.s.}$, {\it i.e.}, the energies of the ground state and the 1st excited state of the gluon field in the presence of the static three quarks. From the accurate and thorough calculation for more than 300 different patterns of 3Q systems, the static ground-state 3Q potential $V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm g.s.}$ is found to be well described by the Coulomb plus Y-type linear potential, {\it i.e.}, Y-Ansatz, within 1%-level deviation. As a clear evidence for Y-Ansatz, Y-type flux-tube formation is actually observed on the lattice in maximally-Abelian projected QCD. For more than 100 patterns of 3Q systems, we calculate the 1st excited-state 3Q potential $V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm e.s.}$ in quenched lattice QCD, and find the gluonic excitation energy $\Delta E_{\rm 3Q} \equiv V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm e.s.}-V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm g.s.}$ to be about 1 GeV. This large gluonic-excitation energy is conjectured to ensure the success of the quark model for the low-lying hadrons even without gluonic excitations. "
"The purpose of the study is to further investigate the classical Gibbs analysis of the heterogeneous system ""stressed crystal - melt."" It is demonstrated that each equilibrium configuration is stable with respect to a special class of variations introduced by Gibbs. This basic result is compared with the opposite result on the universal morphological instability of phase interface separating a stressed crystal with its melt. Some plausible manifestations of the instabilities implied by the Gibbs model are qualitatively discussed. "
"Holonomy corrections to scalar perturbations are investigated in the loop quantum cosmology framework. Due to the effective approach, modifications of the algebra of constraints generically lead to anomalies. In order to remove those anomalies, counter-terms are introduced. We find a way to explicitly fulfill the conditions for anomaly freedom and we give explicit expressions for the counter-terms. Surprisingly, the ""new quantization scheme"" naturally arises in this procedure. The gauge invariant variables are found and equations of motion for the anomaly-free scalar perturbations are derived. Finally, some cosmological consequences are discussed qualitatively. "
"We consider the sums $S(k)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{nk}}{(2n+1)^k}$ and $\zeta(2k)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2k}}$ with $k$ being a positive integer. We evaluate these sums with multiple integration, a modern technique. First, we start with three different double integrals that have been previously used in the literature to show $S(2)=\pi^2/8,$ which implies Euler's identity $\zeta(2)=\pi^2/6.$ Then, we generalize each integral in order to find the considered sums. The $k$ dimensional analogue of the first integral is the density function of the quotient of $k$ independent, nonnegative Cauchy random variables. In seeking this function, we encounter a special logarithmic integral that we can directly relate to $S(k).$ The $k$ dimensional analogue of the second integral, upon a change of variables, is the volume of a convex polytope, which can be expressed as a probability involving certain pairwise sums of $k$ independent uniform random variables. We use combinatorial arguments to find the volume, which in turn gives new closed formulas for $S(k)$ and $\zeta(2k).$ The $k$ dimensional analogue of the last integral, upon another change of variables, is an integral of the joint density function of $k$ Cauchy random variables over a hyperbolic polytope. This integral can be expressed as a probability involving certain pairwise products of these random variables, and it is equal to the probability from the second generalization. Thus, we specifically highlight the similarities in the combinatorial arguments between the second and third generalizations. "
"The family of negative torus links $T_{p,q}$ over a fixed number of strands $p$ admits a stable limit in reduced Khovanov homology as $q$ grows to infinity. In this paper, we endow this stable space with a bi-graded commutative algebra structure. We describe these algebras explicitly for $p=2,3,4$. As an application, we compute the homology of two families of links, and produce a lower bound for the width of the homology of any $4$-stranded torus link. "
"The spring-mass system studied in undergraduate physics laboratories may show complex dynamics due to the simultaneous action of gravitational, elastic, and torsional forces, in addition to air friction. In this paper, we describe a laboratory exercise that caters to beginning students while giving those with more background an opportunity to explore more complex aspects of the motion. If students are not given predefined apparatus but are allowed to design the experiment setup, they may also learn something about physics thinking and experimental procedure. Using results thus produced, we describe a variety of spring-mass oscillation patterns, discussing the physics of the significant deviations from simple harmonic motion. The parametric oscillation behavior we have observed is reported and investigated. This study is based on analysis of motion waveforms. "
"Path-integral Monte Carlo calculations were performed to study the adsorption of $^4$He atoms on $\alpha$-graphyne. We find that one $^4$He atom can be embedded onto the in-plane center of each hexagon of the graphyne. In the first $^4$He layer above the $^4$He-embedded graphyne surface, a Mott insulating state was observed at the areal density of 0.0706 \AA$^{-2}$ with three $^4$He atoms occupying each hexagonal cell while the helium atoms form a commensurate triangular solid at a density of 0.0941 \AA$^{-2}$. Here we show that the Ising pseudo-spin symmetry introduced for two degenerate configurations of three $^4$He atoms in a hexagonal cell can be broken by additional $^4$He atoms placed at the hexagon vertices and the Mott-insulator to commensurate-solid transition is a transition from a nonmagnetic spin liquid of frustrated antiferromagnets to a spin-aligned ferromagnet under a particle-induced pseudo-magnetic field. "
"We propose a unification scenario for supersymmetric intersecting brane models. The quarks and leptons are embedded into adjoint representations of SO(32), which are obtained and break by type I string compactified on orbifolds. Its single unified gauge coupling can give rise to different gauge couplings below the unification scale, due to effects of magnetic fluxes. The crucial mechanism is brane recombination preserving supersymmetry. "
"We study two kinds of transformation groups of a compact locally conformally Kahler (l.c.K.) manifold. First we study compact l.c.K. manifolds with parallel Lee form by means of the existence of a holomorphic l.c.K. flow. Next, we introduce the Lee-Cauchy-Riemann (LCR) transformations as a class of diffeomorphisms preserving the specific G-structure of l.c.K. manifolds. We show that compact l.c.K. manifolds admitting a non-compact CC^* flow of LCR transformations are rigid: it is holomorphically conformal to a Hopf manifold with parallel Lee form. "
We consider a multi-string configuration that provides a new way to compute the expectation value of the Polyakov loop in a five-dimensional framework known as AdS/QCD. The obtained results are in reasonably good agreement with those obtained by lattice simulations for pure SU(3) gauge theory and also by the usual single string configuration. 
"The angular distribution and differential branching fraction of the decay $B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ are studied with a dataset corresponding to $1.0\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, collected by the LHCb experiment. The angular distribution is measured in bins of dimuon invariant mass squared and found to be consistent with Standard Model expectations. Integrating the differential branching fraction over the full dimuon invariant mass range yields a total branching fraction of $\mathcal{B}(B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}) = (4.36 \pm 0.15 \pm 0.18)\times 10^{-7}$. These measurements are the most precise to date of the $B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay. "
"We extend some results of Marmi--Moussa--Yoccoz on the cohomological equations and local conjugacy classes of interval exchange maps of restricted Roth type. In particular, we answer a question of Krikorian about the codimension of the local conjugacy class of self-similar interval exchange maps associated to the Eierlegende Wollmilchsau and the Ornithorynque. "
"Using operator algebraic methods we show that the moment generating function of charge transport in a system with infinitely many non-interacting Fermions is given by a determinant of a certain operator in the one-particle Hilbert space. The formula is equivalent to a formula of Levitov and Lesovik in the finite dimensional case and may be viewed as its regularized form in general. Our result embodies two tenets often realized in mesoscopic physics, namely, that the transport properties are essentially independent of the length of the leads and of the depth of the Fermi sea. "
"Bayesian experimental design (BED) is a tool for guiding experiments founded on the principle of expected information gain. I.e., which experiment design will inform the most about the model can be predicted before experiments in a laboratory are conducted. BED is also useful when specific physical questions arise from the model which are answered from certain experiments but not from other experiments. BED can take two forms, and these two forms are expressed in three example models in this work. The first example takes the form of a Bayesian linear regression, but also this example is a benchmark for checking numerical and analytical solutions. One of two parameters is an estimator of the synthetic experimental data, and the BED task is choosing among which of the two parameters to inform (limited experimental observability). The second example is a chemical reaction model with a parameter space of informed reaction free energy and temperature. The temperature is an independent experimental design variable explored for information gain. The second and third examples are of the form of adjusting an independent variable in the experimental setup. The third example is a catalytic membrane reactor similar to a plug-flow reactor. For this example, a grid search over the independent variables, temperature and volume, for the greatest information gain is conducted. Also, maximum information gain is conducted is optimized with two algorithms: the differential evolution algorithm and steepest ascent, both of which benefitted in terms of initial guess from the grid search. "
"We present a census of circumstellar disks in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. Using the Infrared Array Camera and the Multiband Imaging Photometer onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have obtained images of Chamaeleon I at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 um. To search for new disk-bearing members of the cluster, we have performed spectroscopy on objects that have red colors in these data. Through this work, we have discovered four new members of Chamaeleon I with spectral types of M4, M6, M7.5, and L0. The first three objects are highly embedded (A_J~5) and reside near known protostars, indicating that they may be among the youngest low-mass sources in the cluster (<1 Myr). The L0 source is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I. Its luminosity implies a mass of 0.004-0.01 M_sun, making it the least massive brown dwarf for which a circumstellar disk has been reliably detected. To characterize the disk population in Chamaeleon I, we have classified the infrared spectral energy distributions of the 203 known members that are encompassed by the Spitzer images. Through these classifications, we find that the disk fraction in Chamaeleon I is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3 M_sun. These data are similar to the disk fraction of IC 348, which is a denser cluster at the same age as Chamaeleon I. However, the disk fraction at M>1 M_sun is significantly higher in Chamaeleon I than in IC 348 (65% vs. 20%), indicating longer disk lifetimes in Chamaeleon I for this mass range. Thus, low-density star-forming regions like Chamaeleon I may offer more time for planet formation around solar-type stars than denser clusters. "
"Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) plays a key role in biological sequence analyses, especially in phylogenetic tree construction. Extreme increase in next-generation sequencing results in shortage of efficient ultra-large biological sequence alignment approaches for coping with different sequence types. Distributed and parallel computing represents a crucial technique for accelerating ultra-large sequence analyses. Based on HAlign and Spark distributed computing system, we implement a highly cost-efficient and time-efficient HAlign-II tool to address ultra-large multiple biological sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction. After comparing with most available state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results indicate the following: 1) HAlign-II can efficiently carry out MSA and construct phylogenetic trees with ultra-large biological sequences; 2) HAlign-II shows extremely high memory efficiency and scales well with increases in computing resource; 3) HAlign-II provides a user-friendly web server based on our distributed computing infrastructure. HAlign-II with open-source codes and datasets was established at http://lab.malab.cn/soft/halign. "
"For classical groups SL(n), SO(n) and Sp(2n), we define uniformly geometric valuations on the corresponding complete flag varieties. The valuation in every type comes from a natural coordinate system on the open Schubert cell and is combinatorially related to the Gelfand-Zetlin pattern in the same type. In types A and C, we identify the corresponding Newton-Okounkov polytopes with the Feigin-Fourier-Littelmann-Vinberg polytopes. In types B and D, we compute low-dimensional examples and formulate open questions. "
"Non-Abelian discrete family symmetries play a pivotal role in the formulation of models with tri-bimaximal lepton mixing. We discuss how to obtain symmetries such as A4, semidirect product of Z7 and Z3, and Delta(27) from an underlying SU(3) gauge symmetry. Higher irreducible representations are required to achieve the spontaneous breaking of the continuous group. We present methods of identifying the required vacuum alignments and discuss in detail the symmetry breaking potentials. "
"Brain metabolism is controlled by complex regulation mechanisms. As part of their nature many complex systems show scaling behavior in their timeseries data. Corresponding scaling exponents can sometimes be used to characterize these systems. Here we present maps of scaling exponents derived from BOLD functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, and show that they reveal activation patterns in the human brain with very high precision. In contrast to standard model-based analysis we use no prior knowledge on the experimental stimulation paradigm for extracting activation patterns from fMRI timeseries. We demonstrate that mental activity is one-to-one related to large fractal exponents, or equivalently, to temporally highly correlated processes. "
A relation between Schur algebras and Steenrod algebra is shown in [Hai10] where to each strict polynomial functor the author associates an unstable module. We show that the restriction of Hai's functor to the subcategory of strict polynomial functors of a given degree is fully faithfull. 
"In this paper we design an iterative domain decomposition method for free boundary problems with nonlinear flux jump condition. Our approach is related to damped Newton's methods. The proposed scheme requires, in each iteration, the approximation of the flux on (both sides of) the free interface. We present a Finite Element implementation of our method. The numerical implementation uses harmonically deformed triangulations to inexpensively generate finite element meshes in subdomains. We apply our method to a simplified model for jet flows in pipes and to a simple magnetohydrodynamics model. Finally, we present numerical examples studying the convergence of our scheme. "
"We study the band dispersion of graphene with randomly distributed structural defects using two complementary methods, exact diagonalization of the tight-binding Hamiltonian and implementing a self-consistent T matrix approximation. We identify three distinct types of impurities resulting in qualitatively different spectra in the vicinity of the Dirac point. First, resonant impurities, such as vacancies or 585 defects, lead to stretching of the spectrum at the Dirac point with a finite density of localized states. This type of spectrum has been observed in epitaxial graphene by photoemission spectroscopy and discussed extensively in the literature. Second, nonresonant (weak) impurities, such as paired vacancies or Stone-Wales defects, do not stretch the spectrum but provide a line broadening that increases with energy. Finally, disorder that breaks sublattice symmetry, such as vacancies placed in only one sublattice, open a gap around the Dirac point and create an impurity band in the middle of this gap. We find good agreement between the results of the two methods and also with the experimentally measured spectra. "
"In order to construct a dielectric analog of spaser, we study theoretically and experimentally several configurations of cluster-based unit cells for an all-dielectric metasurface characterized by resonant conditions of the trapped mode excitation. Excitation of the trapped mode is realized by either specific displacement of particles in the cluster, or perturbation of the equidistantly spaced particles by off-centered round holes or coaxial-sector notches. It turns out that the latter approach is more advantageous for enhancement of electric near-field with homogeneous distribution in-plane of the structure and its strong localization outside the high-refractive-index dielectric particles. This feature opens prospects for realization of highly desirable subwavelength flat lasing structures based on strong near-field interaction with substances exhibiting pronounced nonlinear characteristics and properties of gain media. "
"To characterize the possible magnetic structures created on magnetic multilayers a model has been formulated and studied. The interlayer inhomogeneous structures found indicate either (i) a regular periodic, (ii) a quasiperiodic change in the magnetization or (iii) spatially chaotic glass states. The magnetic structures created depend mainly on the ratio of the magnetic anisotropy constant to the exchange constant. With the increase of this ratio the periodic structures first transform into the quasiperiodic and then into the chaotic glass states. The same tendency arises with the depolarization of the magnetic moments of the first layer deposited on the substrate. "
"We find families of prime knot diagrams with arbitrary extreme coefficients in their Jones polynomials. Some graph theory is presented in connection with this problem, generalizing ideas by Yongju Bae and Morton and giving a positive answer to a question in their paper. "
"Photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) is a currently developing spectral approach that characterizes quantum electron-light interactions in electron energy gain/loss spectrum, with symmetrically discretized gains or losses of light quanta ($\hbar \omega$), coupled with a laser induced optical near-field. In this letter, we have demonstrated that Linear Particle Accelerator (LPA) and anomalous PINEM (APINEM) can analytically emerge from PINEM-kind interaction in a strong coupling regime, because of quantum interference of spectral photon sidebands overlap. Furthermore, we also found that the quantum interference in point-particle regime with pre-interaction drift can produce interesting optical spectral focusing and a periodically bunching of energy/momentum distribution that enable us to improve the spectral resolution of electron microscopy, imaging and spectroscopy. These observation of LPA and APINEM in strong laser physics can be of great interests for both theoretical and experimental communities, such as ultrafast electron microscopes, attosecond science and laser-driven accelerators. "
"We study bilayer fermionic cold atom systems with dipolar interactions, as well as a two-component tunable pseudopotential (TCTP) model which keeps only the zeroth and first Haldane pseudopotentials, at total Landau level filling factor 1/2. Our numerical results on the TCTP model indicates that Haldane-Rezayi state describes the critical point between strong and weak d-wave pairing quantum Hall phases. Further increasing the attractive zeroth pseudopotentials, the system transits from the strong-pairing phase to a stripe phase, and then to a cluster phase (or phase separation). The dipolar interaction can be mapped onto the TCTP model in the strong-pairing phase, if high order pseudopotentials are ignored. Our numerical results show that this is indeed the case, so the strong-pairing phase can be realized in the cold atom system. "
"Representational similarity analysis (RSA) has been shown to be an effective framework to characterize brain-activity profiles and deep neural network activations as representational geometry by computing the pairwise distances of the response patterns as a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM). However, how to properly analyze and visualize the representational geometry as dynamics over the time course from stimulus onset to offset is not well understood. In this work, we formulated the pipeline to understand representational dynamics with RDM movies and Procrustes-aligned Multidimensional Scaling (pMDS), and applied it to neural recording of monkey IT cortex. Our results suggest that the the multidimensional scaling alignment can genuinely capture the dynamics of the category-specific representation spaces with multiple visualization possibilities, and that object categorization may be hierarchical, multi-staged, and oscillatory (or recurrent). "
"The purpose of the present paper is to investigate some structural and qualitative aspects of two different perturbations of the parameters of $g$-fractions. In this context the concept of \emph{gap} $g$-fractions is introduced. While tail sequences of a continued fraction play a significant role in the first perturbation, Schur fractions are used in the second perturbation of the $g$-parameters that are considered. Illustrations are provided using Gaussian hypergeometric functions. Using a particular gap $g$-fraction, some members of the class of Pick functions are also identified. "
"The Oeljeklaus-Toma (OT-) manifolds are complex manifolds constructed by Oeljeklaus and Toma from certain number fields, and generalizing the Inoue surfaces $S_m$. On each OT-manifold we construct a holomorphic line bundle with semipositive curvature form and trivial Chern class. Using this form, we prove that the OT-manifolds admitting a locally conformally Kahler structure have no non-trivial complex subvarieties. The proof is based on the Strong Approximation theorem for number fields, which implies that any leaf of the null-foliation of w is Zariski dense. "
"The radiation pressure exerted by incoherent light on diverse surfaces is examined. The thermodynamic rule, first given by Carnot in 1824, describes the limitation to the amount of free energy that can be obtained from a source of thermal energy, and he gave the compelling reason for this rule, that if more free energy than he had prescribed could ever be extracted, then a heat pump could use that free energy and re-create all the heat energy that had been consumed. A perpetual motion machine could then be constructed. Now, 179 years later, it is proposed to fly a spacecraft that is expected to gain velocity from the radiation pressure the sunlight is expected to exert on solar sails, panels of thin plastic sheets, mirror surfaced on the side facing the sun. However a detailed examination of this proposal shows it to be in direct conflict with Carnot's rule, and no such pressure can be expected. Either Carnot's accepted rule is in error, or the solar sail proposal will not work at all. "
"The coupling of internal electronic excitations to vibrational modes of the external motion of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice is studied here in using a perturbation expansion in small atomic displacements. In the Mott insulator case with one atom per site, the resonance dipole-dipole coupling between neighboring sites can induce emission and absorption of vibrational quanta. Within a cavity in the strong exciton-photon coupling regime such coupling results in polariton-vibration interactions, which create a significant thermalization mechanism for polaritons toward their minimum energy, and leading to motional heating of the lattice atoms. "
"We present images of the recent galaxy merger NGC 3256 obtained with the WFPC2 of the Hubble Space Telescope in B and I filters. We show that there is a large population of more than 1,000 compact, bright blue objects in this galaxy within the 7 kpc x 7 kpc region studied. These objects have sizes, colors and luminosities like those expected for young Galactic globular clusters with ages ranging from a few to several hundred Myr. On this basis, we identify at least some fraction of the compact, bright blue objects in NGC 3256 as young globular clusters. The young cluster system comprises 15-20% of the luminosity of the galaxy in B and half that in I within the region studied, indicating a high efficiency of cluster formation on a galaxy-wide scale. We find that the intrinsic color distribution is broad, and there is no significant trend of color with magnitude. The combination of the broad range of observed colors and the lack of a trend of redder colors at fainter magnitudes can not be fit solely by a broad age distribution and/or differential reddening, although the latter is clearly present. The observations can be accounted for by either the preferential depletion/destruction of lower mass clusters as they age, or a very young age (<= 20 Myr) for the cluster population, comparable to or less than the dynamical time of the region in which the clusters are observed. We also find that the luminosity function of the young cluster system can be roughly fit by a power-law with an exponent of -1.8, with tentative evidence that it flattens at faint magnitudes. The clusters are compact in size, with typical estimated half-light radii of 5-10 parsecs, but there is no obvious cut-off for larger radii, and only a shallow trend of size with luminosity. (slightly abridged). "
"Numerical studies of the May-Leonard model for cyclically competing species exhibit spontaneous spatial structures in the form of spirals. It is desirable to obtain a simple coarse-grained evolution equation describing spatio-temporal pattern formation in such spatially extended stochastic population dynamics models. Extending earlier work on the corresponding deterministic system, we derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as the effective representation of the fully stochastic dynamics of this paradigmatic model for cyclic dominance near its Hopf bifurcation, and for small fluctuations in the three-species coexistence regime. The internal stochastic reaction noise is accounted for through the Doi-Peliti coherent-state path integral formalism, and subsequent mapping to three coupled non-linear Langevin equations. This analysis provides constraints on the model parameters that allow time scale separation and in consequence a further reduction to just two coarse-grained slow degrees of freedom. "
"We study electron-electron contact-interaction searches in the process e^+e^-\to e^+e^- at a future e^+e^- Linear Collider with both beams longitudinally polarized. We evaluate the model-independent constraints on the coupling constants, emphasizing the role of beam polarization, and make a comparison with the case of e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-. "
"One way to model the strange metal phase of certain materials is via a holographic description in terms of probe D-branes in a Lifshitz spacetime, characterised by a dynamical exponent z. The background geometry is dual to a strongly-interacting quantum critical theory while the probe D-branes are dual to a finite density of charge carriers that can exhibit the characteristic properties of strange metals. We compute holographically the low-frequency and low-momentum form of the charge density and current retarded Green's functions in these systems for massless charge carriers. The results reveal a quasi-particle excitation when z<2, which in analogy with Landau Fermi liquids we call zero sound. The real part of the dispersion relation depends on momentum k linearly, while the imaginary part goes as k^2/z. When z is greater than or equal to 2 the zero sound is not a well-defined quasi-particle. We also compute the frequency-dependent conductivity in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Using that as a measure of the charge current spectral function, we find that the zero sound appears only when the spectral function consists of a single delta function at zero frequency. "
"Soergel bimodule category B is a categorification of the Hecke algebra of a Coxeter system (W,S). We find a presentation of B (as a tensor category) by generators and relations when W is a right-angled Coxeter group. "
"I demonstrate that the chiral properties of Domain Wall Fermions (DWF) in the large to intermediate lattice spacing regime of QCD, 1 to 2 GeV, are significantly improved by adding to the action two standard Wilson fermions with supercritical mass equal to the negative DWF five dimensional mass. Using quenched DWF simulations I show that the eigenvalue spectrum of the transfer matrix Hamiltonian develops a substantial gap and that the residual mass decreases appreciatively. Furthermore, I confirm that topology changing remains active and that the hadron spectrum of the added Wilson fermions is above the lattice cutoff and therefore is irrelevant. I argue that this result should also hold for dynamical DWF and furthermore that it should improve the chiral properties of related fermion methods. "
"Broadband, coherent light carrying optical angular momentum is of potential utility for a variety of classical and quantum communication applications, but at present few such sources exist. We study the generation of supercontinua in a ring array of coupled optical fibres. Short pulses carrying discrete angular momentum undergo soliton fission, spontaneously breaking azimuthal symmetry. This results in a train of pulses with a broadband frequency spectrum as well as a non-trivial angular momentum distribution. These spatio-temporal solitary waves, localised around a single fibre core, emit an unusual form of resonant radiation which can be present even in the absence of intrinsic higher order dispersion, being induced by the lattice dispersion of the ring array. We explore how the coupling properties between fibre cores affect the resulting supercontinuum, in particular how mildly twisting the array can effectively manipulate its angular momentum content and resonant frequencies through the induced Peierls phase. "
"We generalize the concept of the spin-momentum locking to magnonic systems and derive the formula to calculate the spin expectation value for one-magnon states of general two-body spin Hamiltonians. We give no-go conditions for magnon spin to be independent of momentum. As examples of the magnon spin-momentum locking, we analyze a one-dimensional antiferromagnet with the N\'eel order and two-dimensional kagome lattice antiferromagnets with the 120$^\circ$ structure. We find that the magnon spin depends on its momentum even when the Hamiltonian has the $z$-axis spin rotational symmetry, which can be explained in the context of a singular band point or a $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. A spin vortex in momentum space generated in a kagome lattice antiferromagnet has the winding number $Q=-2$, while the typical one observed in topological insulator surface states is characterized by $Q=+1$. A magnonic analogue of the surface states, the Dirac magnon with $Q=+1$, is found in another kagome lattice antiferromagnet. We also derive the sum rule for $Q$ by using the Poincar\'e-Hopf index theorem. "
"The classical paradox of social choice theory asserts that there is no fair way to deterministically select a winner in an election among more than two candidates; the only definite collective preferences are between individual pairs of candidates. Combinatorially, one may summarize this information with a graph-theoretic tournament on N vertices (one per candidate), placing an edge from U to V if U would beat V in an election between only those two candidates (no ties are permitted). One well-studied procedure for selecting a winner is to specify a complete binary tree whose leaves are labeled by the candidates, and evaluate it by running pairwise elections between the pairs of leaves, sending the winners to successive rounds of pairwise elections which ultimately terminate with a single winner. This structure is called a voting tree. Much research has investigated which functions on tournaments are computable in this way. Fischer, Procaccia, and Samorodnitsky quantitatively studied the computability of the Copeland rule, which returns a vertex of maximum out-degree in the given tournament. Perhaps surprisingly, the best previously known voting tree could only guarantee a returned out-degree of at least log_2 N, despite the fact that every tournament has a vertex of degree at least (N-1)/2. In this paper, we present three constructions, the first of which substantially improves this guarantee to \Theta(sqrt{N}). The other two demonstrate the richness of the voting tree universe, with a tree that resists manipulation, and a tree which implements arithmetic modulo three. "
"The literature on the theme of gender differences in research performance indicates a quite evident gap in favor of men over women. Beyond the understanding of the factors that could be at the basis of this phenomenon, it is worthwhile understanding if it would be appropriate to conduct the evaluation per population in a manner distinguished by gender. In fact if there is some factor that structurally determines a penalization of performance by women researchers compared to men then the comparative evaluation of organizations' performance that does not take gender into account will lead to an advantage for those that employ more men, under parity in the capacities of their staffs. In this work we measure the differences of the performance and the rank of research institutions as observed when gender is taken into account compared to when it is ignored. The study population consists of all Italian universities and the performance measured in the hard sciences for the period 2006-2010. "
"The sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have been stubbornly elusive. However, the latest report of the Pierre Auger Observatory provides a compelling indication for a possible correlation between the arrival directions of UHECRs and nearby starburst galaxies. We argue that if starbursts are sources of UHECRs, then particle acceleration in the large-scale terminal shock of the superwind that flows from the starburst engine represents the best known concept model in the market. We investigate new constraints on the model and readjust free parameters accordingly. We show that UHECR acceleration above about 10^{11} GeV remains consistent with observation. We also show that the model could accommodate hard source spectra as required by Auger data. We demonstrate how neutrino emission can be used as a discriminator among acceleration models. "
"Ever brighter light sources, fast parallel detectors, and advances in phase retrieval methods, have made ptychography a practical and popular imaging technique. Compared to previous techniques, ptychography provides superior robustness and resolution at the expense of more advanced and time consuming data analysis. By taking advantage of massively parallel architectures, high-throughput processing can expedite this analysis and provide microscopists with immediate feedback. These advances allow real-time imaging at wavelength limited resolution, coupled with a large field of view. Here, we introduce a set of algorithmic and computational methodologies used at the Advanced Light Source, and DOE light sources packaged as a CUDA based software environment named SHARP (http://camera.lbl.gov/sharp), aimed at providing state-of-the-art high-throughput ptychography reconstructions for the coming era of diffraction limited light sources.

"Glycerol and trehalose-glycerol binary solutions are glass-forming liquids with remarkable bioprotectant properties. Incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) is used to reveal the different effects of nanoconfinement and addition of trehalose on the molecular dynamics in the normal liquid and supercooled liquid phases, on a nanosecond timescale. Confinement has been realized in straight channels of diameter D=8 nm formed by porous silicon. It leads to a faster and more inhomogeneous relaxation dynamics deep in the liquid phase. This confinement effect remains at lower temperature where it affects the glassy dynamics. The glass transitions of the confined systems are shifted to low temperature with respect to the bulk ones. Adding trehalose tends to slow down the overall glassy dynamics and increases the non-exponential character of the structural relaxation. Unprecedented results are obtained for the binary bioprotectant solution, which exhibits an extremely non-Debye relaxation dynamics as a result of the combination of the effects of confinement and mixing of two constituents. "
"We generalise and offer a different proof of a recent $L^2$ square function estimate on UR sets by Hofmann, Mitrea, Mitrea and Morris. The proof is a short argument using the $\alpha$-numbers of Tolsa. "
"We have realized a dual-species Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb atoms and observed their immiscibility. Because of the favorable background intra- and inter-species scattering lengths, stable condensates can be obtained via efficient evaporative cooling and sympathetic cooling without the need for fine tuning of the interactions. Our system thus provides a clean platform for studying inter-species interactions driven effects in superfluid mixtures. With a Feshbach resonance, we have successfully created double BECs with largely tunable inter-species interactions and studied the miscible-immiscible phase transition. "
"The standard treatment of gravitational lensing by a point mass lens M is based on a weak-field deflection angle a = 2/x, where x = (r c^2)/(2 G M) with r the distance of closest approach to the mass of a lensed light ray. It was shown that for a point mass lens, the total magnification and image centroid shift of a point source remain unchanged by relativistic corrections of second order in 1/x. This paper considers these issues analytically taking into account the relativistic images, under three standard lensing configuration assumptions, for a Schwarzschild black hole lens with background point and extended sources having arbitrary surface brightness profiles. We apply our results to the Galactic black hole for lensing scenarios where our assumptions hold. We show that a single factor characterizes the full relativistic correction to the weak-field image centroid and magnification. As the lens-source distance increases, the relativistic correction factor strictly decreases. In particular, we find that for point and extended sources about 10 pc behind the black hole (which is a distance significantly outside the tidal disruption radius of a sun-like source), the relativistic correction factor is miniscule, of order 10^{-14}. Therefore, for standard lensing configurations, any detectable relativistic corrections to microlensing by the Galactic black hole will most likely have to come from sources significantly closer to the black hole. "
"The Skorokhod Embedding problem is well understood when the underlying process is a Brownian motion. We examine the problem when the underlying is the simple symmetric random walk and when no external randomisation is allowed. We prove that any measure on Z can be embedded by means of a minimal stopping time. However, in sharp contrast to the Brownian setting, we show that the set of measures which can be embedded in a uniformly integrable way is strictly smaller then the set of centered probability measures: specifically it is a fractal set which we characterise as an iterated function system. Finally, we define the natural extension of several known constructions from the Brownian setting and show that these constructions require us to further restrict the sets of target laws. "
"Noncommutative geometry governs the physics of quantum Hall (QH) effects. We introduce the Weyl ordering of the second quantized density operator to explore the dynamics of electrons in the lowest Landau level. We analyze QH systems made of $N$-component electrons at the integer filling factor $\nu=k\leq N$. The basic algebra is the SU(N)-extended W$_{\infty}$. A specific feature is that noncommutative geometry leads to a spontaneous development of SU(N) quantum coherence by generating the exchange Coulomb interaction. The effective Hamiltonian is the Grassmannian $G_{N,k}$ sigma model, and the dynamical field is the Grassmannian $G_{N,k}$ field, describing $k(N-k)$ complex Goldstone modes and one kind of topological solitons (Grassmannian solitons).

"We present angle resolved photoemission spectra for Cu(100) and Cu(111) singly crystals in normal emission geometry, taken at tightly spaced intervals for photon energies between 8 eV and 150 eV. This systematic collection of spectra gives unprecedented insight into the influence of the final states to the photoemission process as well as the band structure and lifetimes of highly excited electrons in Cu. "
"The first part of this paper consists of lecture notes which summarize the machinery of filtered root invariants. A conceptual notion of ""homotopy Greek letter element"" is also introduced, and evidence is presented that it may be related to the root invariant. In the second part we compute some low dimensional root invariants of v_1-periodic elements at the prime 2. "
We consider a quantum Bose fluid confined in a triple well potential in 1D within the exact N-body Bose-Hubbard model to investigate the phenomena of intrinsic decoherence and loss of purity. Our study is done by following the time evolution of one-body properties in an N-particle closed environment. We do an exhaustive exploration of initial conditions to characterize these phenomena. Here we illustrate our main findings with a set of relevant Fock and SU(3) coherent states. Our study shows that signatures of stationarity and maximal mixing are a direct consequence of the inter-particle interactions in the closed system and become evident as the number of particles is increased. This fact is confirmed by quantifying the deviations from stationarity by means of a matrix norm. 
"Self-stabilization ensures that, after any transient fault, the system recovers in a finite time and eventually exhibits. Speculation consists in guaranteeing that the system satisfies its requirements for any execution but exhibits significantly better performances for a subset of executions that are more probable. A speculative protocol is in this sense supposed to be both robust and efficient in practice. We introduce the notion of speculative stabilization which we illustrate through the mutual exclusion problem. We then present a novel speculatively stabilizing mutual exclusion protocol. Our protocol is self-stabilizing for any asynchronous execution. We prove that its stabilization time for synchronous executions is diam(g)/2 steps (where diam(g) denotes the diameter of the system). This complexity result is of independent interest. The celebrated mutual exclusion protocol of Dijkstra stabilizes in n steps (where n is the number of processes) in synchronous executions and the question whether the stabilization time could be strictly smaller than the diameter has been open since then (almost 40 years). We show that this is indeed possible for any underlying topology. We also provide a lower bound proof that shows that our new stabilization time of diam(g)/2 steps is optimal for synchronous executions, even if asynchronous stabilization is not required. "
"Feature extraction from infrared (IR) images remains a challenging task. Learning based methods that can work on raw imagery/patches have therefore assumed significance. We propose a novel multi-task extension of the widely used sparse-representation-classification (SRC) method in both single and multi-view set-ups. That is, the test sample could be a single IR image or images from different views. When expanded in terms of a training dictionary, the coefficient matrix in a multi-view scenario admits a sparse structure that is not easily captured by traditional sparsity-inducing measures such as the $l_0$-row pseudo norm. To that end, we employ collaborative spike and slab priors on the coefficient matrix, which can capture fairly general sparse structures. Our work involves joint parameter and sparse coefficient estimation (JPCEM) which alleviates the need to handpick prior parameters before classification. The experimental merits of JPCEM are substantiated through comparisons with other state-of-art methods on a challenging mid-wave IR image (MWIR) ATR database made available by the US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate.

"We report preliminary measurements of absolute hadronic branching fractions of Ds mesons determined using a double tag technique. These measurements are from 195 pb^{-1} of e+e- collisions recorded at center of mass energies near 4.17 GeV with the CLEO-c detector at CESR. We obtain absolute branching fractions for Ds+ decays to KS0 K+, K- K+ pi+, K- K+ pi+ pi-, pi+ pi+ pi-, pi+ eta, and pi+ etaprime. We discuss the problems inherent in measuring accurately the branching fraction for Ds+ to phi pi+, which is often used as a reference mode for measurement of other Ds+ branching fractions, and provide a measurement of a branching fraction that may be useful for this purpose. "
"We present a catalog of quasars selected from broad-band photometric ugri data of the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 3 (KiDS DR3). The QSOs are identified by the random forest (RF) supervised machine learning model, trained on SDSS DR14 spectroscopic data. We first cleaned the input KiDS data from entries with excessively noisy, missing or otherwise problematic measurements. Applying a feature importance analysis, we then tune the algorithm and identify in the KiDS multiband catalog the 17 most useful features for the classification, namely magnitudes, colors, magnitude ratios, and the stellarity index. We used the t-SNE algorithm to map the multi-dimensional photometric data onto 2D planes and compare the coverage of the training and inference sets. We limited the inference set to r<22 to avoid extrapolation beyond the feature space covered by training, as the SDSS spectroscopic sample is considerably shallower than KiDS. This gives 3.4 million objects in the final inference sample, from which the random forest identified 190,000 quasar candidates. Accuracy of 97%, purity of 91%, and completeness of 87%, as derived from a test set extracted from SDSS and not used in the training, are confirmed by comparison with external spectroscopic and photometric QSO catalogs overlapping with the KiDS footprint. The robustness of our results is strengthened by number counts of the quasar candidates in the r band, as well as by their mid-infrared colors available from WISE. An analysis of parallaxes and proper motions of our QSO candidates found also in Gaia DR2 suggests that a probability cut of p(QSO)>0.8 is optimal for purity, whereas p(QSO)>0.7 is preferable for better completeness. Our study presents the first comprehensive quasar selection from deep high-quality KiDS data and will serve as the basis for versatile studies of the QSO population detected by this survey. "
"The Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymmetric tensor field arises naturally in the gravitational multiplet of string theory. Nevertheless, the respective low-energy field theory action, in which, for reasons of gauge invariance, the only dependence on the KR field is through its field strength, constitutes an interesting model \emph{per se}. In this context, the KR field strength also acts as a totally antisymmetric torsion field, while in four space-time dimensions is \emph{dual} to an (KR) axion-like pseudoscalar field. In this context, we review here first the r\^ole of quantum fluctuations of the KR axion on the generation of Majorana mass for neutrinos, via a mixing with ordinary axions that may exist in the theory as providers of dark matter candidates. Then we proceed to discuss the r\^ole of constant in time (thus Lorentz violating) KR torsion backgrounds, that may exist in the early Universe but are completely negligible today, on inducing Leptogenesis by means of \emph{tree-level} CP violating decays of Right Handed Massive Majorana neutrinos in the presence of such H-torsion backgrounds. Some speculations regarding microscopic D-brane world models, where such scenarios may be realised, are also given. "
In this paper we give a combinatorial parametrization of leading terms of defining relations for level $k$ standard modules for affine Lie algebra of type $C_{n}\sp{(1)}$. Using this parametrization we conjecture colored Rogers-Ramanujan type combinatorial identities for $n\geq 2$ and $k\geq 2$; the identity in the case $n=k=1$ is equivalent to one of Capparelli's identities. 
"Noticeable deviations from the prediction of the fiducial LCDM cosmology are found in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. Besides large-angle anomalies, the WMAP 1st year data revealed a dip in the power spectrum at l \sim 200, which seemed to disappear in the 3rd year and subsequent angular power spectra. Using the WMAP 1st, 3rd, and 5th year data as well as the 5 year coadded data, we study the intensity and spatial distribution of this feature in order to unveil its origin and its implications for the cosmological parameters. We show that in all WMAP data releases there is a substantial suppression of the first Doppler peak in a region near the north ecliptic pole. "
"For any atoroidal iwip $\phi \in Out(F_N)$ the mapping torus group $G_\phi=F_N\rtimes_\phi <t>e$ is hyperbolic, and the embedding $\iota: F_N \overset{\lhd}{\longrightarrow} G_\phi$ induces a continuous, $F_N$-equivariant and surjective {\em Cannon-Thurston map} $\hat \iota: \partial F_N \to \partial G_\phi$. We prove that for any $\phi$ as above, the map $\hat \iota$ is finite-to-one and that the preimage of every point of $\partial G_\phi$ has cardinality $\le 2N$. We also prove that every point $S\in \partial G_\phi$ with $\ge 3$ preimages in $\partial F_N$ has the form $(wt^m)^\infty$ where $w\in F_N, m\ne 0$, and that there are at most $4N-5$ distinct $F_N$-orbits of such {\em singular} points in $\partial G_\phi$ (for the translation action of $F_N$ on $\partial G_\phi$). By contrast, we show that for $k=1,2$ there are uncountably many points $S\in \partial G_\phi$ (and thus uncountably many $F_N$-orbits of such $S$) with exactly $k$ preimages in $\partial F_N$. "
"The abundance of open-source code, coupled with the success of recent advances in deep learning for natural language processing, has given rise to a promising new application of machine learning to source code. In this work, we explore the use of a Siamese recurrent neural network model on Python source code to create vectors which capture the semantics of code. We evaluate the quality of embeddings by identifying which problem from a programming competition the code solves. Our model significantly outperforms a bag-of-tokens embedding, providing promising results for improving code embeddings that can be used in future software engineering tasks. "
"A new calculation of R_{dAu} has been performed using the 2003 d+Au data and the higher-statistics 2005 p+p data. These nuclear modification factors are compared to calculations using nuclear-modified PDFs and a J/psi breakup cross section is extracted. These values are then used to project the cold nuclear matter effects in Au+Au collisions. Additionally, a more data-driven projection is performed. "
"For any odd integer N, we explicitly write down the Eisenstein cycles in the first homology group of modular curves of level N as linear combinations of Manin symbols. These cycles are, by definition, those over which every integral of holomorphic differential forms vanish. Our result can be seen as an explicit version of the Manin-Drinfeld Theorem. Our method is to characterize such Eisenstein cycles as eigenvectors for the Hecke operators. We make crucial use of expressions of Hecke actions on modular symbols and on auxiliary level 2 structures. "
"Using methods of condensed matter and statistical physics, we examine the transport of excitons through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex from a receiving antenna to a reaction center. Writing the equations of motion for the exciton creation/annihilation operators, we are able to describe the exciton dynamics, even in the regime when the reorganization energy is of the order of the intra-system couplings. In particular, we obtain the well-known quantum oscillations of the site populations. We determine the exciton transfer efficiency in the presence of a quenching field and protein environment. While the majority of the protein vibronic modes are treated as a heat bath, we address the situation when specific modes are strongly coupled to excitons and examine the effects of these modes on the quantum oscillations and the energy transfer efficiency. We find that, for the vibronic frequencies below 16 meV, the exciton transfer is drastically suppressed. We attribute this effect to the formation of ""polaronic states"" where the exciton is transferred back and forth between the two pigments with the absorption/emission of the vibronic quanta, instead of proceeding to the reaction center. The same effect suppresses the quantum beating at the vibronic frequency of 25 meV. We also show that the efficiency of the energy transfer can be enhanced when the vibronic mode strongly couples to the third pigment only, instead of coupling to the entire system. "
"The financial crisis has dramatically demonstrated that the traditional approach to apply univariate monetary risk measures to single institutions does not capture sufficiently the perilous systemic risk that is generated by the interconnectedness of the system entities and the corresponding contagion effects. This has brought awareness of the urgent need for novel approaches that capture systemic riskiness. The purpose of this paper is to specify a general methodological framework that is flexible enough to cover a wide range of possibilities to design systemic risk measures via multi-dimensional acceptance sets and aggregation functions, and to study corresponding examples. Existing systemic risk measures can usually be interpreted as the minimal capital needed to secure the system after aggregating individual risks. In contrast, our approach also includes systemic risk measures that can be interpreted as the minimal capital funds that secure the aggregated system by allocating capital to the single institutions before aggregating the individual risks. This allows for a possible ranking of the institutions in terms of systemic riskiness measured by the optimal allocations. Moreover, we also allow for the possibility of allocating the funds according to the future state of the system (random allocation). We provide conditions which ensure monotonicity, convexity, or quasi-convexity properties of our systemic risk measures. "
"In this paper we extend the coupled fixed point theorems for mixed monotone operators $F:X \times X \rightarrow X$ obtained in [T.G. Bhaskar, V. Lakshmikantham, \textit{Fixed point theorems in partially ordered metric spaces and applications}, Nonlinear Anal. TMA \textbf{65} (2006) 1379-1393] by significantly weakening the involved contractive condition. Our technique of proof is essentially different and more natural. An example as well an application to periodic BVP are also given in order to illustrate the effectiveness of our generalizations. "
"Yuan and Shields claim that our data-encryption protocol is entirely equivalent to a classical stream cipher utilizing no quantum phenomena. Their claim is, indeed, false. Yuan and Shields also claim that schemes similar to the one presented in Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 227901 are not suitable for key generation. This claim is also refuted. In any event, we welcome the opportunity to clarify the situation for a wider audience. "
"It is well known that if a group G factorizes as G = NH where H\leq G and N is normal in G then the group structure of G is determined by the subgroups H and N, the intersection of N with H and how H acts on N with a homomorphism f : H -> Aut(N). Here we generalize the idea by creating extensions using the semi-automorphism group of N. We show that if G=NH is a Moufang loop, N is a normal subloop, and H=<u> is a finite cyclic group of order coprime to three then the binary operation of G depends only on the binary operation of N, the intersection of N with H, and how u permutes the elements of N as a semi-automorphism of N. "
"Mean-field models are a popular tool in a variety of fields. They provide an understanding of the impact of interactions among a large number of particles or people or other ""self-interested agents"", and are an increasingly popular tool in distributed control. This paper considers a particular randomized distributed control architecture introduced in our own recent work. In numerical results it was found that the associated mean-field model had attractive properties for purposes of control. In particular, when viewed as an input-output system, its linearization was found to be minimum phase. In this paper we take a closer look at the control model. The results are summarized as follows: (i) The Markov Decision Process framework of Todorov is extended to continuous time models, in which the ""control cost"" is based on relative entropy. This is the basis of the construction of a family of controlled Markovian generators. (ii) A decentralized control architecture is proposed in which each agent evolves as a controlled Markov process. A central authority broadcasts a common control signal to each agent. The central authority chooses this signal based on an aggregate scalar output of the Markovian agents. (iii) Provided the control-free system is a reversible Markov process, the following identity holds for the linearization, \[ \text{Real} (G(j\omega)) = \text{PSD}_Y(\omega)\ge 0, \quad \omega\in\Re, \] where the right hand side denotes the power spectral density for the output of any one of the individual (control-free) Markov processes.

"This talk is based on my work in collaboration with B. Boisseau, D. Polarski, and A.A. Starobinsky. The most natural and best-motivated alternatives to general relativity are the so-called ""scalar-tensor"" theories, in which the gravitational interaction is mediated not only by a (spin-2) graviton, but also by a (spin-0) scalar field. We study quintessence in this general framework, and show that the microscopic Lagrangian of the theory can be unambiguously reconstructed from two observable cosmological functions of the redshift: the luminosity distance and the linear density perturbation of dustlike matter. We also analyze the constraints imposed on the theory by the knowledge of only the first of these functions, as it will probably be available sooner with a good accuracy. [The main interest of this very short paper is to give the equations in the ""Brans-Dicke"" parametrization.] "
"A predator-prey model of dual populations with stochastic oscillators is presented. A linear cross-coupling between the two populations is introduced following the coupling between the motions of a Wilberforce pendulum in two dimensions: one in the longitudinal and the other in torsional plain. Within each population a Kuramoto type competition between the phases is assumed. Thus, the synchronisation state of the whole system is controlled by these two types of competitions. The results of the numerical simulations show that by adding the linear cross-coupling interactions predator-prey oscillations between the two populations appear which results in self-regulation of the system by a transfer of synchrony between the two populations. The model represents several important features of the dynamical interplay between the drift wave and zonal flow turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas, and a novel interpretation of the coupled dynamics of drift wave-zonal flow turbulence using synchronisation of stochastic oscillator is discussed. "
"We consider a novel paradigm for Bayesian testing of hypotheses and Bayesian model comparison. Our alternative to the traditional construction of posterior probabilities that a given hypothesis is true or that the data originates from a specific model is to consider the models under comparison as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original testing problem with an estimation one that focus on the probability weight of a given model within a mixture model. We analyze the sensitivity on the resulting posterior distribution on the weights of various prior modeling on the weights. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective is that generic improper priors are acceptable, while not putting convergence in jeopardy. Among other features, this allows for a resolution of the Lindley-Jeffreys paradox. When using a reference Beta B(a,a) prior on the mixture weights, we note that the sensitivity of the posterior estimations of the weights to the choice of a vanishes with the sample size increasing and avocate the default choice a=0.5, derived from Rousseau and Mengersen (2011). Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the classical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterior mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are quite similar. "
Given a locally convex vector space with a topology induced by Hilbert seminorms and a continuous bilinear form on it we construct a topology on its symmetric algebra such that the usual star product of exponential type becomes continuous. Many properties of the resulting locally convex algebra are explained. We compare this approach to various other discussions of convergent star products in finite and infinite dimensions. We pay special attention to the case of a Hilbert space and to nuclear spaces. 
"In this paper, the dynamical heteroclinic orbit and attractor have been employed to make the late-time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition and thus alleviates the fine tuning problem in cosmological dynamical system of barotropic fluid and quintessence with a double exponential potential. The late-time asymptotic behavior of the double exponential model does not always correspond to the single case. The heteroclinic orbits are the non-stationary solutions and in general they will interpolate between the critical points. Although they can not be shown analytically, yet a numerical calculation can reveal most of their properties. Varied heteroclinic orbits and attractors including tracking attractor and de Sitter attractor have been found. "
"In this review, we have studied the quasielastic production cross sections and polarization components of $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^0$ and $\Sigma^-$ hyperons induced by the weak charged currents in the antineutrino reactions on the nucleon and the nuclear targets like $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ar and $^{208}$Pb. It is shown that the energy and the $Q^2$ dependence of the cross sections and the various polarization components can be effectively used to determine the axial vector transition form factors in the strangeness sector and test the validity of various symmetry properties of the weak hadronic currents like G-invariance, T-invariance and SU(3) symmetry. In particular, the energy and the $Q^2$ dependence of the polarization components of the hyperons is found to be sensitive enough to determine the presence of the second class current with or without T-invariance. These hyperons decay dominantly into pions giving an additional contribution to the weak pion production induced by the antineutrinos. This contribution is shown to be quantitatively significant as compared to the pion production by the $\Delta$ excitation in the nuclear targets in the sub-GeV energy region relevant for the $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ cross section measurements in the oscillation experiments. We have also included a few new results, based on our earlier works, which are in the kinematic region of the present and future (anti)neutrino experiments being done with the accelerator (anti)neutrinos at T2K, MicroBooNE, MiniBooNE, NO$\nu$A, MINER$\nu$A and DUNE, as well as for the atmospheric (anti)neutrino experiments in this energy region.

"Ferropericlase, (Mg,Fe)O is one of the most abundant minerals of the Earth's lower mantle. The high-spin (HS) to low-spin (LS) transition in the Fe2+ ions can dramatically alter the physical and chemical properties of (Mg,Fe)O in the deep mantle, thereby changing our understanding of the Earth's deep interior. To establish a fundamental understanding of the ground electronic state of iron, the electronic and magnetic states of Fe2+ in (Mg0.75,Fe0.25)O have been investigated by transmission (TMS) and synchrotron (NFS) M\""ossbauer spectroscopy at high pressures and low temperatures (down to 5 K). The results show that the ground electronic state of Fe2+ at the critical pressure Pc of the spin transition and close to T=0 is determined by a quantum critical point Pq (T = 0, Pc) where the energy difference between the HS and LS states (an energy gap for the spin fluctuation) is zero. The deviation from T=0 leads to the thermal excitation for the HS or LS state, suggesting a strong influence on the magnetic and hence the physical properties of the material. Combining these with theoretical calculations, the results indicate that the existence of the quantum critical point at zero temperature affects not only the low-temperature physical properties, but also the strong temperature/pressure-dependent properties at conditions relevant to the middle layer of the lower mantle.

"We have developed a three-dimensional (3D) spectral hydrodynamic code to study vortex dynamics in rotating, shearing, stratified systems (e.g. the atmosphere of gas giant planets, protoplanetary disks around newly forming protostars). The time-independent background state is stably stratified in the vertical direction and has a unidirectional linear shear flow aligned with one horizontal axis. Superposed on this background state is an unsteady, subsonic flow that is evolved with the Euler equations subject to the anelastic approximation to filter acoustic phenomena. A Fourier-Fourier basis in a set of quasi-Lagrangian coordinates that advect with the background shear is used for spectral expansions in the two horizontal directions. For the vertical direction, two different sets of basis functions have been implemented: (1) Chebyshev polynomials on a truncated, finite domain, and (2) rational Chebyshev functions on an infinite domain. Use of this latter set is equivalent to transforming the infinite domain to a finite one with a cotangent mapping, and using cosine and sine expansions in the mapped coordinate. The nonlinear advection terms are time integrated explicitly, whereas the Coriolis force, buoyancy terms, and pressure/enthalpy gradient are integrated semi-implicitly. We show that internal gravity waves can be damped by adding new terms to the Euler equations. The code exhibits excellent parallel performance with the Message Passing Interface (MPI). As a demonstration of the code, we simulate the merger of two 3D vortices in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk. "
"Let $(R,\m)$ and $(S,\n)$ be commutative Noetherian local rings, and let $\phi:R\to S$ be a flat local homomorphism such that $\m S = \n$ and the induced map on residue fields $R/\m \to S/\n$ is an isomorphism. Given a finitely generated $R$-module $M$, we show that $M$ has an $S$-module structure compatible with the given $R$-module structure if and only if $\Ext^i_R(S,M)=0$ for each $i\ge 1$. We say that an $S$-module $N$ is {\it extended} if there is a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ such that $N\cong S\otimes_RM$. Given a short exact sequence $0 \to N_1\to N \to N_2\to 0$ of finitely generated $S$-modules, with two of the three modules $N_1,N,N_2$ extended, we obtain conditions forcing the third module to be extended. We show that every finitely generated module over the Henselization of $R$ is a direct summand of an extended module, but that the analogous result fails for the $\m$-adic completion. "
"In this paper we evolve magnetized and unmagnetized circumbinary accretion disks around supermassive black hole binaries in the relativistic regime. We use a post-Newtonian expansion to construct an analytical spacetime and determine how the order of the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion affects the dynamics of the gas. We find very small differences in the late-time bulk dynamics of non-magnetized hydrodynamic evolutions between the two spacetimes down to separations of approximately $40GM/c^2$ where $M$ is the total mass of the binary. For smaller separations, the differences due to PN-order become comparable to differences caused by using initial data further from equilibrium. For magnetized gas, MHD stresses, which drives the accretion dynamics, tends to mask all higher order PN effects even at separations of $20GM/c^2$, leading to essentially the same observed electromagnetic luminosity. This implies that our calculations of the EM signal may be robust down to small binary separations. Our investigation is the first to demonstrate how the level of PN accuracy affects a circumbinary disk's evolution and informs us of the range in separation within which to trust the PN approximation for this kind of study. We also address the influence the initial conditions and binary separation have on simulation predictions. "
"Following recent work on the quantum Hall effect on $S^4$, we solve the Landau problem on the complex projective spaces ${\bf C}P^k$ and discuss quantum Hall states for such spaces. Unlike the case of $S^4$, a finite spatial density can be obtained with a finite number of internal states for each particle. We treat the case of ${\bf C}P^2$ in some detail considering both Abelian and nonabelian background fields. The wavefunctions are obtained and incompressibility of the Hall states is shown. The case of ${\bf C}P^3$ is related to the case of $S^4$. "
"We give a multimensional version of the p-adic heat equation, and show that its fundamental solution is the transition density of a Markov process. "
We propose a physical scheme for implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm using atomic ensembles and optical devices. The scheme has inherent fault tolerance to the realistic noise and efficient scaling with the number of ensembles for some entangled states within the reach of current technology. It would be an important step toward more complex quantum computation via atomic ensembles. 
"The Raman spectra of two G-bands and a radial breathing mode (RBM) of unfilled and filled single-wall semiconducting and metallic carbon nanotubes have been investigated theoretically, in the presence of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. Excitation of low frequency optical plasmons in the metallic nanotube is responsible for the peak known as the Breit-Wigner-Fano (BWF) line shape in the G-band Raman spectra. In a filled nanotube there is an additional peak due to excitation of the phonon of the filling atom or molecule. Positions, shapes and relative strengths of these Raman peaks depend on the phonon frequencies of the nanotube and that of the filling atoms, and strengths and forms of the plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. For example, filling atoms with phonon frequency close to the RBM frequency of the nanotube may broaden and lower the RBM Raman peak to such an extent that it may become barely visible. Hybridization between the G-bands and the filling atom phonon is also strong when these two frequencies are close to each other and it has important effects on the G-band and the BWF line shapes. When the phonon frequency of the filling atom is far from the RBM and G-band frequencies, it gives rise to a separate peak with modest effects on the RBM and G-band spectra. Raman spectra of semiconducting unfilled and filled nanotubes have similar behavior as those of metallic nanotubes except that normally they have Lorentzian line shapes and do not show a BWF line shape. However, if a semiconducting nanotube is filled with donor atoms, it is predicted that the BWF type line shape may be observed near the RBM, or the G-band or the filling atom Raman peak. "
"Traditional Stueckelberg Mechanism is shown equivalent to set up a gauged U(1) chiral Lagrangian and fix special gauge. With this mechanism, the original electro-weak chiral Lagrangian is inlarged by including an extra U(1) symmetry to represent physics for $Z'$ boson. We build up complete list of electro-weak chiral Lagrangian up to order of $p^4$ including $Z'$ and higgs bosons. The most general mixing among neutral gauge bosons is diagonalized completely and the connections among these operators to triple, quartic couplings involving $Z'$ boson and to that in traditional electro-weak chiral Lagrangian are made. "
"Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) offers several tools for qualitative data analysis. One possibility is to group objects that share common attributes together and get a concept lattice that describes the data. Quite often the size of this concept lattice is very large. Many authors have investigated methods to reduce the size of this lattice. In \cite{KMBV14} the authors consider putting together some attributes to reduce the size of the attribute sets. But this reduction does not always carry over the set of concepts. They have provided some counter examples where the size of the concept lattice increases by one after putting two attributes together. Then they asked the following question: ""How many new concepts can be generated by an $\exists$-generalization on just two attributes?"" The present paper provides a family of contexts for which the size increases on more than one concept after putting solely two attributes together. "
"For mass spectra acquired from cancer patients by MALDI or SELDI techniques, automated discrimination between cancer types or stages has often been implemented by machine learnings. These techniques typically generate ""black-box"" classifiers, which are difficult to interpret biologically. We develop new and efficient signature discovery algorithms leading to interpretable signatures combining the discriminating power of explicitly selected small groups of biomarkers, identified by their m/z ratios. Our approach is based on rigorous stochastic modeling of ""homogeneous"" datasets of mass spectra by a versatile class of parameterized Markov Random Fields. We present detailed algorithms validated by precise theoretical results. We also outline the successful tests of our approach to generate efficient explicit signatures for six benchmark discrimination tasks, based on mass spectra acquired from colorectal cancer patients, as well as from ovarian cancer patients. "
"We investigate the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) and homogeneous Sarma superfluid states in alkaline-earth-like $^{173}$Yb atomic gases near an orbital Feshbach resonance at zero temperature with population imbalances in both the open and closed channels (or bands). We find that in homogeneous space by adjusting the open-channel Zeeman energy $h_o$, both the Sarma and Fulde-Ferrell superfluid states are greatly enhanced by the spin-exchange interaction while the closed-channel Zeeman energy $h_c$ remains small. In the presence of an external harmonic trap, the trapped gas features a shell structure of separated phases, where the Sarma phase leaves detectable valley structure in the columnar-integrated momentum distribution, and the Fulde-Ferrell state acquires enhanced spatial anisotropy. As both signatures can be easily detected in time-of-flight images, our findings are helpful to realize and detect the long-sought FFLO and Sarma superfluid states at the same time in experiments. "
"In support of the EPOXI mission, we have compiled the secular light curve (SLC) of comet 103P/Hartley 2, the next target of EPOXI. a) Of the order of 30 photometric parameters are measured, over 20 of them new. The turn on point of activity is -4.2 +/- 0.1 AU from the Sun, which corresponds to -400 +/- 40 d before perihelion. The total active time is TACTIVE= 1484 +/- 43 d. b) 103P is a young dwarf comet, young because it has a photometric age P-AGE(1,1) = 15 +/- 2 cy (comet years), and dwarf because its diameter is DEFFE = 1.14 +/- 0.16 km. c) The nucleus is very active, and the amplitude of the SLC is ASEC= 10.8 +/- 0.1 mag in 1997. This comet is as active as 1P/Halley, but much smaller. d) After remaining active up to aphelion, the comet spills-over its activity into the next orbit. e) Two linear laws change slope at a break point located at RBP = -1.20 +/- 0.1 AU before perihelion, and magnitude mBP = 9.4 +/- 0.1. Sublimation is not controlled by water ice. The controlling substance may be CO or CO2 ice. CO2 has been detected spectroscopically. f) The water budget of this comet is calculated. The comet expends 1.88 10^10 kg of water per apparition. A new water-budget age is defined and it is found that WB-AGE = 19 cy vs WB-AGE = 0.65 cy for 1P/Halley and 28 cy for 9P. g) The values of Af{\rho} are calculated on two dates and we find dust production rates of 106 and 37 kg/s. h) The thickness of the layer lost per apparition is calculated, and we find {\Delta}r = 39 m where r is the radius. Since the radius of this comet is r = 570 m, it is found that at the present rate the comet may disappear in only 17 revolutions (~109 y). i) All comets visited by spacecraft are young objects. 103P follows the same trend. It is expected that the surface morphology that will be found in future EPOXI images should be very similar to that of previous comets. "
"In this paper we propose a new approach to study the properties of the Partial Least Squares (PLS) estimator. This approach relies on the link between PLS and discrete orthogonal polynomials. Indeed many important PLS objects can be expressed in terms of some specific discrete orthogonal polynomials, called the residual polynomials. Based on the explicit analytical expression we have stated for these polynomials in terms of signal and noise, we provide a new framework for the study of PLS. Furthermore, we show that this new approach allows to simplify and retreive independent proofs of many classical results (proved earlier by different authors using various approaches and tools). This general and unifying approach also sheds new light on PLS and helps to gain insight on its properties. "
"Workforce Scheduling and Routing Problems (WSRP) are very common in many practical domains, and usually, have a number of objectives. Illumination algorithms such as Map-Elites (ME) have recently gained traction in application to {\em design} problems, in providing multiple diverse solutions as well as illuminating the solution space in terms of user-defined characteristics, but typically require significant computational effort to produce the solution archive. We investigate whether ME can provide an effective approach to solving WSRP, a {\em repetitive} problem in which solutions have to be produced quickly and often. The goals of the paper are two-fold. The first is to evaluate whether ME can provide solutions of competitive quality to an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) in terms of a single objective function, and the second to examine its ability to provide a repertoire of solutions that maximise user choice. We find that very small computational budgets favour the EA in terms of quality, but ME outperforms the EA at larger budgets, provides a more diverse array of solutions, and lends insight to the end-user. "
"High-resolution ($\Delta E$=1.3 meV) inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) in optimally doped untwinned YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals show that the dispersion of transverse acoustic phonons in the a-direction remains linear with no softening due to bending modes in the long wavelength limit, down to q=0.02. The sound velocity is found to be 2700 +/- 70 m s$^{-1}$, in excellent agreement with ultrasound measurements, and unchanged upon cooling from room temperature to 98 K. These results rule out a strong coupling between bending dynamics of the CuO$_2$ planes and charge carriers in cuprates. "
"Let $W$ be a finitely generated infinite Coxeter group, with $\Phi$ and $\Pi$ being the corresponding root system and set of simple roots respectively. It has been observed by Hohlweg et la that the projections of elements of $\Phi$ onto suitably chosen hyperplanes, called \emph{normalized roots}, are contained in the convex hull of $\Pi$ (which is a compact set), and hence the set of all normalized roots may exhibit interesting asymptotical behaviours. In this paper we investigate the topology of the limit set of the normalized roots and demonstrate a natural system of neighbourhoods around each limit point arising from a non-affine infinite dihedral reflection subgroup of $W$. "
"A quadratic line complex is a three-parameter family of lines in projective space P^3 specified by a single quadratic relation in the Plucker coordinates. Fixing a point p in P^3 and taking all lines of the complex passing through p we obtain a quadratic cone with vertex at p. This family of cones supplies P^3 with a conformal structure. With this conformal structure we associate a three-dimensional second order quasilinear wave equation. We show that any PDE arising in this way is linearly degenerate, furthermore, any linearly degenerate PDE can be obtained by this construction. This provides a classification of linearly degenerate wave equations into eleven types, labelled by Segre symbols of the associated quadratic complexes. We classify Segre types for which the associated conformal structure is conformally flat, as well as Segre types for which the corresponding PDE is integrable. "
"For a prime power $q$ and a positive integer $n$, we say a subspace $U$ of ${\mathbb{F}_q^n}$ is {\em cyclically covering} if the union of the cyclic shifts of $U$ is equal to $\mathbb{F}_q^n$. We investigate the problem of determining the minimum possible dimension of a cyclically covering subspace of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$. (This is a natural generalisation of a problem posed in 1991 by the first author.) We prove several upper and lower bounds, and for each fixed $q$, we answer the question completely for infinitely many values of $n$ (which take the form of certain geometric series). Our results imply lower bounds for a well-known conjecture of Isbell, and a generalisation theoreof, supplementing lower bounds due to Spiga. We also consider the analogous problem for general representations of groups. We use arguments from combinatorics, representation theory and finite field theory. "
"We present VLT/NACO SDI images of the very nearby star SCR 1845-6357 (hereafter SCR 1845). SCR 1845 is a recently discovered (Hambly et al. 2004) M8.5 star just 3.85 pc from the sun (Henry et al. 2006). Using the capabilities of the unique SDI device, we discovered a substellar companion to SCR 1845 at a separation of 4.5 AU (1.170''+-0.003'' on the sky) and fainter by 3.57+-0.057 mag in the 1.575 um SDI filter. This substellar companion has an H magnitude of 13.16+0.31-0.26 (absolute H magnitude of 15.30+0.31-0.26), making it likely the brightest mid-T dwarf known. The unique Simultaneous Differential Imager (SDI) consists of 3 narrowband filters placed around the 1.6 um methane absorption feature characteristic of T-dwarfs (Teff < 1200 K). The flux of the substellar companion drops by a factor of 2.7+-0.1 between the SDI F1(1.575 um) filter and the SDI F3(1.625 um) filter, consistent with strong methane absorption in a substellar companion. We estimate a spectral type of T5.5+-1 for the companion based on the strength of this methane break. The chances that this object is a background T dwarf are vanishing small -- and there is no isolated background T-dwarf in this part of the sky according to 2MASS. Thus, it is a bound companion, hereafter SCR 1845-6357B. For an age range of 100 Myr - 10 Gyr and spectral type range of T4.5-T6.5, we find a mass range of 9 - 65 MJup for SCR 1845B from the Baraffe et al. 2003 COND models. SCR 1845AB is the 24th closest stellar system to the Sun (at 3.85 pc); the only brown dwarf system closer to the Sun is Eps Indi Ba-Bb (at 3.626 pc). In addition, this is the first T-dwarf companion discovered around a low mass star. "
"We describe the technique used to develop on-orbit calibrators for IRAC and validate the method for either K0-M0III or A0-A5V stars. For SIRTF, the approach uses all available optical, NIR, and MIR photometry, and yields absolute spectra from UV to MIR. One set of stars is from Landolt's network of optical standards, the other from Carter-Meadows IR standards. Traceability to the Cohen-Walker- Witteborn framework of absolute photometry and spectra is assured. The method is based on using either ""supertemplates"" to represent the intrinsic shapes of the spectra of K0-M0IIIs from 1150A to 35 um, or Kurucz synthetic spectra for A0-5V stars. Each supertemplate/model is reddened according to a star's extinction and normalized by characterized optical photometry. This paper tests our ability to predict NIR (JHK) magnitudes from supertemplates or models constrained by Hippa- rcos/Tycho or precision ground-based optical data. We offer absolute calibrated spectra of 33 optical standards to demonstrate the viability of this technique for a set of IR calibrators 100-1000 times fainter than we have previously publ- ished. We calculate the absolute uncertainties associated with predicting IRAC mags for the faintest cool giant and hot dwarf in this new set of calibrators. "
"We consider a supersymmetric (SUSY) scenario including right-handed neutrinos, one of whose scalar superpartners is the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). The distinguishing feature in the collider signal of SUSY in such a case is not missing energy but a pair of charged tracks corresponding to the next-to- lightest SUSY particle, when it is, as in the case considered, a stau. Following up on our recent work on neutralino reconstruction in such cases, we explore the possibility of reconstructing charginos, too, through a study of transverse mass distributions in specified final states. The various steps of isolating the transverse momenta of neutrinos relevant for this are outlined, and regions of the parameter space where our procedure works are identified. "
"In this article, we discuss a couple of nonlinear Galerkin method (NLG) in finite element set up for viscoelastic fluid flow, mainly equations of motion arising in the flow of 2D Oldroyd model. We obtain improved error estimate in $L^{\infty}(\bL^2)$ norm, which is optimal in nature, for linear finite element approximation, in view of the error estimate available in literature, in $L^2(\bH^1)$ norm. "
"This study introduces a structured analysis of science parks as arenas designed to stimulate institutional collaboration and the commercialization of academic knowledge and technology, and the promotion of social welfare. A framework for key actors and their potential behaviour in this context is introduced based on the Triple Helix (TH) model and related literature. A link analysis was conducted to build an inter-linking network that may map the infrastructure support network through the online interactions of the organisations involved in York Science Park. A comparison between the framework and the diagram shows that the framework can be used to identify most of the actors and assess their interconnections. The web patterns found correspond to previous evaluations based on traditional indicators and suggest that the network, which is developed to foster and support innovation, arises from the functional cooperation between the University of York and regional authorities, which both serve as the major driving forces in the trilateral linkages and the development of an innovation infrastructure. "
"The Soft Gamma Repeater 1806-20 produced patterns of bursts during its 1983 outburst that indicate multiple independent energy accumulation sites, each driven by a continuous power source, with sudden, incomplete releases of the accumulated energy. The strengths of the power sources and their durations of activity vary over several orders of magnitude. "
"In now classic work, David Kendall (1966) recognized that the Yule process and Poisson process could be related by a (random) time change. Furthermore, he showed that the Yule population size rescaled by its mean has an almost sure exponentially distributed limit as $t\to \infty$. In this note we introduce a class of coupled delayed Yule processes parameterized by $0 < \alpha \le 1$ that includes the Poisson process at $\alpha = {1/2}$. Moreover we extend Kendall's limit theorem to include a larger class of positive martingales derived from functionals that gauge the population genealogy. A somewhat surprising connection with the Holley-Liggett smoothing transformation also emerges in this context. Specifically, the latter is exploited to uniquely characterize the moment generating functions of distributions of the limit martingales, generalizing Kendall's mean one exponential limit. "
"We introduce the notion of sofic measurable equivalence relations. Using them we prove that Connes' Embedding Conjecture as well as the Measurable Determinant Conjecture of L\""uck, Sauer and Wegner hold for treeable equivalence relations. "
"A systematic review identifies and collates various clinical studies and compares data elements and results in order to provide an evidence based answer for a particular clinical question. The process is manual and involves lot of time. A tool to automate this process is lacking. The aim of this work is to develop a framework using natural language processing and machine learning to build information extraction algorithms to identify data elements in a new primary publication, without having to go through the expensive task of manual annotation to build gold standards for each data element type. The system is developed in two stages. Initially, it uses information contained in existing systematic reviews to identify the sentences from the PDF files of the included references that contain specific data elements of interest using a modified Jaccard similarity measure. These sentences have been treated as labeled data.A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on this labeled data to extract data elements of interests from a new article. We conducted experiments on Cochrane Database systematic reviews related to congestive heart failure using inclusion criteria as an example data element. The empirical results show that the proposed system automatically identifies sentences containing the data element of interest with a high recall (93.75%) and reasonable precision (27.05% - which means the reviewers have to read only 3.7 sentences on average). The empirical results suggest that the tool is retrieving valuable information from the reference articles, even when it is time-consuming to identify them manually. Thus we hope that the tool will be useful for automatic data extraction from biomedical research publications. The future scope of this work is to generalize this information framework for all types of systematic reviews. "
"Both gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and blazars have relativistic jets pointing at a small angle from our line of sight. Several recent studies suggested that these two kinds of sources may share similar jet physics. In this work, we explore the variability properties for GRBs and blazars as a whole. We find that the correlation between minimum variability timescale (MTS) and Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$, as found only in GRBs by Sonbas et al. can be extended to blazars with a joint correlation of $\rm MTS\propto\Gamma^{-4.7\pm0.3}$. The same applies to the $\rm MTS\propto \it L_{\gamma}^{\rm -1.0\pm0.1}$ correlation as found in GRBs, which can be well extended into blazars as well. These results provide further evidence that the jets in these two kinds of sources are similar despite of the very different mass scale of their central engines. Further investigations of the physical origin of these correlations are needed, which can shed light on the nature of the jet physics. "
"We solve the satisfiability problem for a three-sorted fragment of set theory (denoted $3LQST_0^R$), which admits a restricted form of quantification over individual and set variables and the finite enumeration operator $\{\text{-}, \text{-}, \ldots, \text{-}\}$ over individual variables, by showing that it enjoys a small model property, i.e., any satisfiable formula $\psi$ of $3LQST_0^R$ has a finite model whose size depends solely on the length of $\psi$ itself. Several set-theoretic constructs are expressible by $3LQST_0^R$-formulae, such as some variants of the power set operator and the unordered Cartesian product. In particular, concerning the unordered Cartesian product, we show that when finite enumerations are used to represent the construct, the resulting formula is exponentially shorter than the one that can be constructed without resorting to such terms. "
"As data science continues to grow in popularity, there will be an increasing need to make data science tools more scalable, flexible, and accessible. In particular, automated machine learning (AutoML) systems seek to automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter, we present a genetic programming-based AutoML system called TPOT that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification problem. Further, we analyze a large database of pipelines that were previously used to solve various supervised classification problems and identify 100 short series of machine learning operations that appear the most frequently, which we call the building blocks of machine learning pipelines. We harness these building blocks to initialize TPOT with promising solutions, and find that this sensible initialization method significantly improves TPOT's performance on one benchmark at no cost of significantly degrading performance on the others. Thus, sensible initialization with machine learning pipeline building blocks shows promise for GP-based AutoML systems, and should be further refined in future work. "
"The development of selective high precision chemical functionalization strategies for device fabrication, in conjunction with associated techniques for patterning graphene wafers with atomic accuracy would provide the necessary basis for a post-CMOS manufacturing technology. This requires a thorough understanding of the principles governing the reactivity and patterning of graphene at the sub-nanometer length scale. This article reviews our quest to delineate the principles of graphene chemistry - that is, the chemistry at the Dirac point and beyond, and the effect of covalent chemistry on the electronic structure, electrical transport and magnetic properties of this low-dimensional material in order to enable the scalable production of graphene-based devices for low- and high-end technology applications. "
"Compact binaries in our galaxy are expected to be one of the main sources of gravitational waves for the future eLISA mission. During the mission lifetime, many thousands of galactic binaries should be individually resolved. However, the identification of the sources, and the extraction of the signal parameters in a noisy environment are real challenges for data analysis. So far, stochastic searches have proven to be the most successful for this problem. In this work we present the first application of a swarm-based algorithm combining Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution. These algorithms have been shown to converge faster to global solutions on complicated likelihood surfaces than other stochastic methods. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for the case of a single binary in a 1 mHz search bandwidth. This interesting problem gave the algorithm plenty of opportunity to fail, as it can be easier to find a strong noise peak rather than the signal itself. After a successful detection of a fictitious low-frequency source, as well as the verification binary RXJ0806.3+1527, we then applied the algorithm to the detection of multiple binaries, over different search bandwidths, in the cases of low and mild source confusion. In all cases, we show that we can successfully identify the sources, and recover the true parameters within a 99\% credible interval. "
"VLBI observations of supernovae and gamma-ray bursts provide almost the only way of obtaining spatially resolved information about the sources. In particular, a determination of the expansion velocity of the forward shock, as well as the geometry of the fireball and its evolution with time are possible for relatively nearby events, provided they are radio bright. Monitoring the expansion of the shock front can provide information on the density profiles of both the circumstellar material and on the ejecta. VLBI observations can also potentially resolve GRB jets which are not directed along the line of sight, providing crucial confirmation of relativistic expansion in such objects. This review gives an overview of recent results from supernovae, including the Type I b/c SNe 2011dh, 2009bb, and 2007gr, and discusses the prospects for future observations. "
"A double nanohole in a metal film was used to trap nanoparticles (20 nm diameter) and simultaneously record their Raman spectrum using the trapping laser as the excitation source. This allowed for the identification of characteristic Stokes lines for titania and polystyrene nanoparticles, showing the capability for material identification of nanoparticles once trapped. Increased Raman signal is observed for the trapping of multiple nanoparticles. This system combines the benefits of nanoparticle isolation and manipulation with unique identification. "
"This paper proves that in Size Theory the comparison of multidimensional size functions can be reduced to the 1-dimensional case by a suitable change of variables. Indeed, we show that a foliation in half-planes can be given, such that the restriction of a multidimensional size function to each of these half-planes turns out to be a classical size function in two scalar variables. This leads to the definition of a new distance between multidimensional size functions, and to the proof of their stability with respect to that distance. "
"We have reanalyzed the long-term optical light curve (LC) of the symbiotic star Z Andromedae, covering 112--yr of mostly visual observations. Two strictly periodic and one quasi-periodic cycles can be identified in this LC. A P1=7550 d quasi periodicity characterizes the repetition time of the outburst episodes of this symbiotic star. Six such events have been recorded so far. During quiescence states of the system, i.e. in time intervals between outbursts, the LC is clearly modulated by a stable coherent period of P2=759.1 d. This is the well known orbital period of the Z And binary system that have been measured also spectroscopically. A third coherent period of P3=658.4 d is modulating the intense fluctuations in the optical brightness of the system during outbursts. We attribute the trigger of the outbursts phenomenon and the clock that drives it, to a solar type magnetic dynamo cycle that operates in the convection and the outer layers of the giant star of the system. We suggest that the intense surface activity of the giant star during maximum phases of its magnetic cycle is especially enhanced in one or two antipode regions, fixed in the atmosphere of the star and rotating with it. Such spots could be active regions around the North and the South poles of a general magnetic dipole field of the star. The P3 periodicity is half the beat of the binary orbital period of the system and the spin period of the giant. The latter is then either 482 or 1790 d. If only one pole is active on the surface of the giant, P3 is the beat period itself, and the spin period is 352 d. It could also be 5000 d if the giant is rotating in retrograde direction. We briefly compare these findings in the LC of Z And to similar modulations that were identified in the LC of two other prototype symbiotics, BF Cyg and YY Her. "
"Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR) workshops serve as the annual gathering of IR researchers who address various information-related tasks on scientific corpora and bibliometrics. The workshop features original approaches to search, browse, and discover value-added knowledge from scientific documents and related information networks (e.g., terms, authors, institutions, references). We welcome contributions elaborating on dedicated IR systems, as well as studies revealing original characteristics on how scientific knowledge is created, communicated, and used. In this paper we introduce the BIR workshop series and discuss some selected papers presented at previous BIR workshops. "
"The paper discusses the similarities and the differences in the mathematical theories of the steady Boltzmann and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed in a bounded domain. First we discuss two different scaling limits in which solutions of the steady Boltzmann equation have an asymptotic behavior described by the steady Navier-Stokes Fourier system. Whether this system includes the viscous heating term depends on the ratio of the Froude number to the Mach number of the gas flow. While the steady Navier-Stokes equations with smooth divergence-free external force always have at least one smooth solutions, the Boltzmann equation with the same external force set in the torus, or in a bounded domain with specular reflection of gas molecules at the boundary may fail to have any solution, unless the force field is identically zero. Viscous heating seems to be of key importance in this situation. The nonexistence of any steady solution of the Boltzmann equation in this context seems related to the increase of temperature for the evolution problem, a phenomenon that we have established with the help of numerical simulations on the Boltzmann equation and the BGK model.

"In this paper we present a new Bayesian network model for classification that combines the naive-Bayes (NB) classifier and the finite-mixture (FM) classifier. The resulting classifier aims at relaxing the strong assumptions on which the two component models are based, in an attempt to improve on their classification performance, both in terms of accuracy and in terms of calibration of the estimated probabilities. The proposed classifier is obtained by superimposing a finite mixture model on the set of feature variables of a naive Bayes model. We present experimental results that compare the predictive performance on real datasets of the new classifier with the predictive performance of the NB classifier and the FM classifier. "
"It has been recently shown that, under the margin (or low noise) assumption, there exist classifiers attaining fast rates of convergence of the excess Bayes risk, that is, rates faster than $n^{-1/2}$. The work on this subject has suggested the following two conjectures: (i) the best achievable fast rate is of the order $n^{-1}$, and (ii) the plug-in classifiers generally converge more slowly than the classifiers based on empirical risk minimization. We show that both conjectures are not correct. In particular, we construct plug-in classifiers that can achieve not only fast, but also super-fast rates, that is, rates faster than $n^{-1}$. We establish minimax lower bounds showing that the obtained rates cannot be improved. "
"In this paper, we investigate the extent to which knowledge compilation can be used to improve inference from propositional weighted bases. We present a general notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any equivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive results are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified, showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time polynomial in the output size. Finally, we sketch how our results can be used in model-based diagnosis in order to compute the most probable diagnoses of a system. "
"We show that a moving vortex lattice, as it comes to a crystal edge, radiates into a free space the harmonics of the washboard frequency, $\omega_0=2\pi v/a$, up to a superconducting gap, $\Delta/\hbar$. Here $v$ is the velocity of the vortex lattice and $a$ is the intervortex spacing. We compute radiation power and show that this effect can be used for generation of terahertz radiation and for characterization of moving vortex lattices. "
"Let $\{(X_i,Y_i)\}$ be a stationary ergodic time series with $(X,Y)$ values in the product space $\R^d\bigotimes \R .$ This study offers what is believed to be the first strongly consistent (with respect to pointwise, least-squares, and uniform distance) algorithm for inferring $m(x)=E[Y_0|X_0=x]$ under the presumption that $m(x)$ is uniformly Lipschitz continuous. Auto-regression, or forecasting, is an important special case, and as such our work extends the literature of nonparametric, nonlinear forecasting by circumventing customary mixing assumptions. The work is motivated by a time series model in stochastic finance and by perspectives of its contribution to the issues of universal time series estimation. "
"We use mid-IR to UV observations to derive a mean attenuation curve out to the rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV) for ""BAL dust"" -- the dust causing the additional extinction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad absorption lines (BALQSOs). In contrast to the normal, relatively flat, mean AGN attenuation curve, BAL dust is well fit by a steeply rising, SMC-like curve. We confirm the shape of the theoretical Weingartner & Draine SMC curve out to 700 \AA, but the drop in attenuation at still shorter wavelengths is less than predicted. The identical attenuation curve for low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs) does not support them being a ""break out"" phase in the life of AGNs. Although attenuation in the optical due to BAL dust is low ($E(B-V) \sim 0.03 - 0.05$), the attenuation rises to one magnitude in the EUV because of the steep extinction curve. Here the dust optical depth is at the optimum value for radiative acceleration of dusty gas. Because the spectral energy distribution of AGNs peaks in the EUV where the optical depth is highest, the force on the dust dominates the acceleration of BAL gas. For LoBALs we get a negative attenuation curve in the optical. This is naturally explained if there is more light scattered into our line of sight in LoBALs compared with non-BALQSOs. We suggest that this and partial covering are causes when attenuation curves appear to be steeper in the UV that an SMC curve. "
"We examine the possibility that the gravitational contribution to the entropy of a system can be identified with some measure of the Weyl curvature. In this paper we consider homothetically self-similar spacetimes. These are believed to play an important role in describing the asymptotic properties of more general models. By exploiting their symmetry properties we are able to impose significant restrictions on measures of the Weyl curvature which could reflect the gravitational entropy of a system. In particular, we are able to show, by way of a more general relation, that the most widely used ""dimensionless"" scalar is \textit{not} a candidate for this measure along homothetic trajectories. "
"In the last years, researchers have realized the difficulties of fitting power-law distributions properly. These difficulties are higher in Zipf's systems, due to the discreteness of the variables and to the existence of two representations for these systems, i.e., two versions about which is the random variable to fit. The discreteness implies that a power law in one of the representations is not a power law in the other, and vice versa. We generate synthetic power laws in both representations and apply a state-of-the-art fitting method (based on maximum-likelihood plus a goodness-of-fit test) for each of the two random variables. It is important to stress that the method does not fit the whole distribution, but the tail, understood as the part of a distribution above a cut-off that separates non-power-law behavior from power-law behavior. We find that, no matter which random variable is power-law distributed, the rank-size representation is not adequate for fitting, whereas the representation in terms of the distribution of sizes leads to the recovery of the simulated exponents, may be with some bias. "
"A potential explanation [U.~D.~Jentschura, Phys.\ Rev.\ A {\bf 88}, 062514 (2013)] of the proton radius puzzle originating from the non-perturbative lepton-pair content of the proton is studied. Well-defined quantities that depend on this lepton-pair content are evaluated. Each is found to be of the order of $10({\alpha\over \pi})^2$, so that we find such a lepton-pair content exists in the proton. However, we argue that this relatively large result and general features of loop diagrams rule out the possibility of lepton-pair content as an explanation of the proton radius puzzle. In addition, the contributions of a class of explanations of the proton radius puzzle (for which the dependence on the $\mu p$ relative distance is as a contact interaction) is determined. "
"We prove a Tits alternative theorem for groups acting on CAT(0) cubical complexes. Namely, suppose that $G$ is a group for which there is a bound on the orders of its finite subgroups. We prove that if $G$ acts properly on a finite-dimensional CAT(0) cubical complex, then either $G$ contains a free subgroup of rank 2 or $G$ is finitely generated and virtually abelian. In particular the above conclusion holds for any group $G$ with a free action on a finite-dimensional CAT(0) cubical complex. "
"The problem of extrapolating the series in powers of small variables to the region of large variables is addressed. Such a problem is typical of quantum theory and statistical physics. A method of extrapolation is developed based on self-similar factor and root approximants, suggested earlier by the authors. It is shown that these approximants and their combinations can effectively extrapolate power series to the region of large variables, even up to infinity. Several examples from quantum and statistical mechanics are analysed, illustrating the approach. "
"In 1993, E. Lesigne proved a polynomial extension of the Wiener-Wintner ergodic theorem and asked two questions: does this result have a uniform counterpart and can an assumption of total ergodicity be replaced by ergodicity? The purpose of this article is to answer these questions, the first one positively and the second one negatively. "
"In this paper, we introduce the concept of monotone Gregus-\'Ciri\'c-contraction mappings in weighted digraphs. Then we establish a fixed point theorem for monotone Gregus-\'Ciri\'c-contraction mappings defined in convex weighted digraphs. "
"One of the major challenges providing large databases like the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA) is to minimize ingest times for pixel/image metadata and catalogue data. In this article we describe how the pipeline processed data are ingested into the database as the first stage in building a release database which will be succeeded by advanced processing (source merging, seaming, detection quality flagging etc.). To accomplish the ingestion procedure as fast as possible we use a mixed Python/C++ environment and run the required tasks in a simple parallel modus operandi where the data are split into daily chunks and then processed on different computers. The created data files can be ingested into the database immediately as they are available. This flexible way of handling the data allows the most usage of the available CPUs as the comparison with sequential processing shows. "
"We review recent progress towards the understanding of higher spin gauge symmetry breaking in AdS space from a holographic vantage point. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, N=4 SYM theory at vanishing coupling constant should be dual to a theory in AdS which exhibits higher spin gauge symmetry enhancement. When the SYM coupling is non-zero, all but a handful of HS currents are violated by anomalies, and correspondingly local higher spin symmetry in the bulk gets spontaneously broken. In agreement with previous results and holographic expectations, we find that, barring one notable exception (spin 1 eating spin 0), the Goldstone modes responsible for HS symmetry breaking in AdS have non-vanishing mass even in the limit in which the gauge symmetry is restored. We show that spontaneous breaking a' la Stueckelberg implies that the mass of the relevant spin s'=s-1 Goldstone field is exactly the one predicted by the correspondence. "
"We report here on a sequence of 28 observations of the binary pulsar system PSR B1259-63/SS2883 at four radio frequencies made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array around the time of the 2000 periastron passage. Observations made on 2000 Sep 1 show that the pulsar's apparent rotation measure (RM) reached a maximum of $-14800 \pm 1800$ rad m$^{-2}$, some 700 times the value measured away from periastron, and is the largest astrophysical RM measured. This value, combined with the dispersion measure implies a magnetic field in the Be star's wind of 6 mG. We find that the light curve of the unpulsed emission is similar to that obtained during the 1997 periastron but that differences in detail imply that the emission disc of the Be star is thicker and/or of higher density. The behaviour of the light curve at late times is best modelled by the adiabatic expansion of a synchrotron bubble formed in the pulsar/disc interaction. The expansion rate of the bubble $\sim 12$ km s$^{-1}$ is surprisingly low but the derived magnetic field of 1.6 G close to that expected. "
"25%-50% of all white dwarfs (WDs) host observable and dynamically active remnant planetary systems based on the presence of close-in circumstellar dust and gas and photospheric metal pollution. Currently-accepted theoretical explanations for the origin of this matter include asteroids that survive the star's giant branch evolution at au-scale distances and are subsequently perturbed onto WD-grazing orbits following stellar mass loss. In this work we investigate the tidal disruption of these highly-eccentric (e > 0.98) asteroids as they approach and tidally disrupt around the WD. We analytically compute the disruption timescale and compare the result with fully self-consistent numerical simulations of rubble piles by using the N-body code PKDGRAV. We find that this timescale is highly dependent on the orbit's pericentre and largely independent of its semimajor axis. We establish that spherical asteroids readily break up and form highly eccentric collisionless rings, which do not accrete onto the WD without additional forces such as radiation or sublimation. This finding highlights the critical importance of such forces in the physics of WD planetary systems. "
"The study of the phenomenon of quantum weak turbulence is extended by determining the quasiparticle spectrum associated with such a system using a Green's function approach. The quasiparticle spectrum calculated establishes the dissipative regime and the inertial regime, hence a Kolmogorov type of picture. "
"In this paper, we propose a novel deep multi-level attention model to address inverse visual question answering. The proposed model generates regional visual and semantic features at the object level and then enhances them with the answer cue by using attention mechanisms. Two levels of multiple attentions are employed in the model, including the dual attention at the partial question encoding step and the dynamic attention at the next question word generation step. We evaluate the proposed model on the VQA V1 dataset. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of multiple commonly used metrics. "
"We obtain a unique, canonical one-to-one correspondence between the space of marked postcritically finite Newton maps of polynomials and the space of postcritically minimal Newton maps of entire maps that take the form $p(z) \text{exp}(q(z))$ for $p(z)$, $q(z)$ polynomials and $\text{exp}(z)$, the complex exponential function. This bijection preserves the dynamics and embedding of Julia sets and is induced by a surgery tool developed by Ha\""issinsky. "
"In a recent publication, we suggested a mechanism for obtaining dynamical CP violation in the early Universe based on the out-of-equilibrium evolution of complex scalar fields. In this paper, we suggest several ways of transferring the CP asymmetry from the scalar sector to the leptonic sector. In particular, we point out how a ``transient MNS(P) matrix'' can generate an asymmetry between fermions and anti-fermions directly. "
"Let $f \in \mathbb{Z}[y]$ be a polynomial such that $f(\mathbb{N}) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and let $p_{\mathcal{A}_{f}}(n)$ denote number of partitions of $n$ whose parts lie in the set $\mathcal{A}_f:=\{f(n):n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Under hypotheses on the roots of $f-f(0)$, we use the Hardy--Littlewood circle method, a polylogarithm identity, and the Matsumoto--Weng zeta function to derive asymptotic formulae for $p_{\mathcal{A}_f}(n)$ as $n$ tends to infinity. This generalises asymptotic formulae for the number of partitions into perfect $d$th powers, established by Vaughan for $d=2$, and Gafni for the case $d \geq 2$, in 2015 and 2016 respectively. "
"We construct a complete equation of state (EOS) covering a wide range of temperature, proton fraction, and baryon density for the use of astrophysical simulations. We employ the relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory to describe nuclear interactions and adopt the Thomas-Fermi approximation to describe the nonuniform nuclear matter. The uniform matter and nonuniform matter are studied consistently using the same RMF theory. "
"The performance of an adaptive optics (AO) system on a 100m diameter ground based telescope working in the visible range of the spectrum is computed using an analytical approach. The target Strehl ratio of 60% is achieved at 0.5um with a limiting magnitude of the AO guide source near R~10, at the cost of an extremely low sky coverage. To alleviate this problem, the concept of tomographic wavefront sensing in a wider field of view using either natural guide stars (NGS) or laser guide stars (LGS) is investigated. These methods use 3 or 4 reference sources and up to 3 deformable mirrors, which increase up to 8-fold the corrected field size (up to 60\arcsec at 0.5 um). Operation with multiple NGS is limited to the infrared (in the J band this approach yields a sky coverage of 50% with a Strehl ratio of 0.2). The option of open-loop wavefront correction in the visible using several bright NGS is discussed. The LGS approach involves the use of a faint (R ~22) NGS for low-order correction, which results in a sky coverage of 40% at the Galactic poles in the visible. "
"We prove a quantitative structure theorem for metrics on $\mathbf{R}^n$ that are conformal to the flat metric, have almost constant positive scalar curvature, and cannot concentrate more than one bubble. As an application of our result, we show a quantitative rate of convergence in relative entropy for a fast diffusion equation in $\mathbf{R}^n$ related to the Yamabe flow. "
We present a brief description of the ``consistent discretization'' approach to classical and quantum general relativity. We exhibit a classical simple example to illustrate the approach and summarize current classical and quantum applications. We also discuss the implications for the construction of a well defined quantum theory and in particular how to construct a quantum continuum limit. 
"We present a new, high-speed technique to track the three-dimensional translation and rotation of non-spherical colloidal particles. We capture digital holograms of micrometer-scale silica rods and sub-micrometer-scale Janus particles freely diffusing in water, and then fit numerical scattering models based on the discrete dipole approximation to the measured holograms. This inverse-scattering approach allows us to extract the the position and orientation of the particles as a function of time, along with static parameters including the size, shape, and refractive index. The best-fit sizes and refractive indices of both particles agree well with expected values. The technique is able to track the center of mass of the rod to a precision of 35 nm and its orientation to a precision of 1.5$^\circ$, comparable to or better than the precision of other 3D diffusion measurements on non-spherical particles. Furthermore, the measured translational and rotational diffusion coefficients for the silica rods agree with hydrodynamic predictions for a spherocylinder to within 0.3%. We also show that although the Janus particles have only weak optical asymmetry, the technique can track their 2D translation and azimuthal rotation over a depth of field of several micrometers, yielding independent measurements of the effective hydrodynamic radius that agree to within 0.2%. The internal and external consistency of these measurements validate the technique. Because the discrete dipole approximation can model scattering from arbitrarily shaped particles, our technique could be used in a range of applications, including particle tracking, microrheology, and fundamental studies of colloidal self-assembly or microbial motion. "
"We construct an electromagnetic field whose scalar potential is a pulsed-beam wavelet Psi (an analytic continuation of a classical Huygens wavelet). The vector potential A is determined up to three complex parameters by requiring that (a) it satisfies the Lorenz gauge condition with Psi, (b) its current density is supported on the same disk D as the charge density of Psi, (c) it is axisymmetric, and (d) it has the same retarded time dependence as Psi. By choosing one of the parameters in A appropriately, the electromagnetic field generated by the four-potential (A, Psi) can be made null, meaning that E^2=B^2 and E dot B=0. We call such fields coherent because upon being radiated, they do not loiter around the source, generating electromagnetic inertia (a new concept related to reactive energy) but immediately propagate out at the speed of light. The coherent EM wavelets define a twisting null congruence of light rays in Minkowski space, which we show to be identical to the Kerr congruence associated with the Kerr-Newman metric. The latter represents a black hole due to a time-independent charge-current density on a massive disk D spinning at the angular velocity c/a, where a is the radius of D. By contrast, our coherent wavelets are electromagnetic pulsed beams radiated by pulsed charge-current distributions on D, still spinning at the uniform rate c/a. "
"This note records a curious numerical identity: the number 1318, connected with Vandermonde's cyclotomic quintic, may be decomposed in two distinct ways as a sum of products of pairs of numbers taken from the set \{$6, 16, 26, 41$\}, namely $1318 = 6\cdot41 + 16\cdot26 + 16\cdot41 = 6\cdot16 + 6\cdot26 + 26\cdot41$. Based on the existence of radical solutions of certain families of Abelian and generalized Abelian equations, we conjecture the existence of an infinite number of analogous decompositions, involving arbitrarily large sets of numbers. "
We study pullback from a topological viewpoint with emphasis on pullback of covering maps. We generalize a triad of Quillen on properties of the pullback functor. 
The recent theoretical progress in the description of semileptonic decays in the framework of the heavy mass expansion is summarized. Both inclusive and exclusive decays are considered. 
"If V and W are varieties of algebras such that any V-algebra A has a reduct U(A) in W, there is a forgetful functor U: V->W that acts by A |-> U(A) on objects, and identically on homomorphisms. This functor U always has a left adjoint F: W->V by general considerations. One calls F(B) the V-algebra freely generated by the W-algebra B. Two problems arise naturally in this broad setting. The description problem is to describe the structure of the V-algebra F(B) as explicitly as possible in terms of the structure of the W-algebra B. The recognition problem is to find conditions on the structure of a given V-algebra A that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a W-algebra B such that F(B) is isomorphic to A. Building on and extending previous work on MV-algebras freely generated by finite distributive lattices, in this paper we provide solutions to the description and recognition problems in case V is the variety of MV-algebras, W is the variety of Kleene algebras, and B is finitely generated--equivalently, finite. The proofs rely heavily on the Davey-Werner natural duality for Kleene algebras, on the representation of finitely presented MV-algebras by compact rational polyhedra, and on the theory of bases of MV-algebras.

Let C be an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve of arithmetic genus 4. We prove that the family of such curves of degree 8 in $P^4_k$ is irreducible. 
"We study the behaviour of Dirac current in expanding spacetime with Schr{\""o}dinger and de Sitter form for the evolution of the scale-factor. The study is made to understand the particle-antiparticle rotation and the evolution of quantum vacuum leading to particle production in such spacetime. "
"Interest in non-standard recombination scenarios has been spurred by recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) results from BOOMERANG and MAXIMA, which show an unexpectedly low second acoustic peak, resulting in a best-fit baryon density that is 50% larger than the prediction of big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This apparent discrepancy can be avoided if the universe has a non-standard ionization history in which the recombination of hydrogen is significantly delayed relative to the standard model. While future CMB observations may eliminate this discrepancy, it is useful to develop a general framework for analyzing non-standard ionization histories. We develop such a framework, examining non-standard models in which the hydrogen binding energy E_b and the overall expression for the time rate of change of the ionized fraction of electrons are multiplied by arbitrary factors. This set of models includes a number of previously-proposed models as special cases. We find a wide range of models with delayed recombination that are able to fit the CMB data with a baryon density in accordance with BBN, but there are even allowed models with earlier recombination than in the standard model. A generic prediction of these models is that the third acoustic CMB peak should be very low relative to what is found in the standard model. This is the case even for the models with earlier recombination than in the standard model, because here the third peak is lowered by an increased diffusion damping at recombination relative to the standard model. Interestingly, the specific height of the third peak depends sensitively on the model parameters, so that future CMB measurements will be able to distinguish between different non-standard recombination scenarios. "
"Recently there has been a lot of interest around the world in the use of nuclear reactors to measure theta 13, the last undetermined angle in the 3-neutrino mixing scenario. In this paper the motivations for theta 13 measurement using short baseline nuclear reactor experiments are discussed. The features of such an experiment are described in the context of Double Chooz, which is a new project planned to start data-taking in 2008, and to reach a sensitivity of sinsq(2 theta 13) < 0.03. "
"In this paper a pipelined architecture of a high speed network security processor (NSP) for SSL,TLS protocol is implemented on a system on chip (SOC) where hardware information of all encryption, hashing and key exchange algorithms are stored in flash memory in terms of bit files, in contrary to related works where all are actually implemented in hardware. The NSP finds applications in e-commerce, virtual private network (VPN) and in other fields that require data confidentiality. The motivation of the present work is to dynamically execute applications with stipulated throughput within budgeted hardware resource and power. A preferential algorithm choosing an appropriate cipher suite is proposed, which is based on Efficient System Index (ESI) budget comprising of power, throughput and resource given by the user. The bit files of the chosen security algorithms are downloaded from the flash memory to the partial region of field programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed SOC controls data communication between an application running in a system through a PCI and the Ethernet interface of a network. Partial configuration feature is used in ISE14.4 suite with ZYNQ 7z020-clg484 FPGA platform. The performances "
"A fast algorithm for Antoine and Vandergheynst's (1998) directional continuous spherical wavelet transform (CSWT) is presented. Computational requirements are reduced by a factor of O(\sqrt{N}), when N is the number of pixels on the sphere. The spherical Mexican hat wavelet Gaussianity analysis of the WMAP 1-year data performed by Vielva et al. (2003) is reproduced and confirmed using the fast CSWT. The proposed extension to directional analysis is inherently afforded by the fast CSWT algorithm. "
"(Abridged) We report results of three dimensional MHD simulations of global accretion disks threaded with weak vertical magnetic fields. We perform the simulations in the spherical coordinates with different temperature profiles and accordingly different rotation profiles. In the cases with a spatially constant temperature, because the rotation frequency is vertically constant in the equilibrium condition, general properties of the turbulence are quantitatively similar to those obtained in local shearing box simulations. On the other hand, in the cases with a radially variable temperature profile, the vertical differential rotation, which is inevitable in the equilibrium condition, winds up the magnetic field lines, in addition to the usual radial differential rotation. As a result, the coherent wound magnetic fields contribute to the Maxwell stress in the surface regions. We obtain nondimensional density and velocity fluctuations ~0.1-0.2 at the midplane. The azimuthal power spectra of the magnetic fields show shallow slopes, ~m^0- m^{-1}, than those of velocity and density. We observe intermittent and structured disk winds driven by the Poynting flux associated with the MHD turbulence. The Poynting flux originating from magnetic tension is injected from the regions above a scale height towards both the midplane and the surfaces. Related to this, sound waves are directed to the midplane from the surface regions. The mass accretion mainly occurs near the surfaces and the gas near the midplane slowly moves outward, which causes large-scale meridional circulations. The vertical magnetic fields are also dragged inward in the surface regions, while they stochastically move outward and inward around the midplane. We also discuss an observational implication of induced spiral structure in the simulated turbulent disks to protoplanetary disks. "
"We report on experiments that consist in deforming a collection of monodisperse droplets produced by a microfluidic chip through a flow-focusing device. We show that a proper numerical modelling of the flow is necessary to access the stress applied by the latter on the droplet along its trajectory through the chip. This crucial step enables the full integration of the differential equation governing the dynamical deformation, and consequently the robust measurement of the interfacial tension by fitting the experiments with the calculated deformation. Our study thus demonstrates the feasibility of quantitative in-situ rheology in microfluidic flows involving e.g. droplets, capsules or cells. "
"Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete icc subgroup of PSL(2,R) of infinite covolume. and let M denote the quotient of the unit disc by $\Gamma$. We prove that a Toeplitz operator with $\Gamma$-invariant symbol f in C(M) is Brauer Fredholm if its symbol is invertible on the boundary of M and its Brauer index is equal to the winding number of f at the boundary. We construct the associated extension of the algebra of functions continuous on the boundary of M by the Brauer ideal in the C*-algebra generated by such operators. "
"In this paper, we develop a method for obtaining the approximate solution for the evolution of single-step transformations under non-isothermal conditions. We have applied it to many reaction models and obtained very simple analytical expressions for the shape of the corresponding transformation rate peaks. These analytical solutions represent a significant simplification of the system's description allowing easy curve fitting to experiment. A remarkable property is that the evolutions of the transformed fraction obtained at different heating rates are identical when time is scaled by a time constant. The accuracy achieved with our method is checked against several reaction models and different temperature dependencies of the transformation rate constant. It is shown that its accuracy is closely related with that of the Kissinger method. "
"The NA60 experiment has studied J/psi production in p-A collisions at 158 and 400 GeV, at the CERN SPS. Nuclear effects on the J/psi yield have been estimated from the A-dependence of the production cross section ratios sigma_{J/psi}^{A}/sigma_{J/psi}^{Be} (A=Al, Cu, In, W, Pb, U). We observe a significant nuclear suppression of the J/psi yield per nucleon-nucleon collision, with a larger effect at lower incident energy, and we compare this result with previous observations by other fixed-target experiments. An attempt to disentangle the different contributions to the observed suppression has been carried out by studying the dependence of nuclear effects on x_2, the fraction of nucleon momentum carried by the interacting parton in the target nucleus. "
"Synthetic lipid membranes can display channel-like ion conduction events even in the absence of proteins. We show here that these events are voltage-gated with a quadratic voltage dependence as expected from electrostatic theory of capacitors. To this end, we recorded channel traces and current histograms in patch-experiments on lipid membranes. We derived a theoretical current-voltage relationship for pores in lipid membranes that describes the experimental data very well when assuming an asymmetric membrane. We determined the equilibrium constant between closed and open state and the open probability as a function of voltage. The voltage-dependence of the lipid pores is found comparable to that of protein channels. Lifetime distributions of open and closed events indicate that the channel open distribution does not follow exponential statistics but rather power law behavior for long open times. "
We consider the SU(2) lattice gauge model and investigate numerically the continuum limit of the simple center vortices which are singular configurations of the gauge fields. We found that the vortices remain alive in the continuum theory. Also we investigate the Creutz ratio and found that for all $\beta$ it vanishes for those field configurations which do not contain the simple center vortices inside the considered Wilson loop. It leads us to the conclusion that these singular field configurations play a real role in the continuum theory. 
"Image-to-image (i2i) translation is the dense regression problem of learning how to transform an input image into an output using aligned image pairs. Remarkable progress has been made in i2i translation with the advent of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and particular using the learning paradigm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In the absence of paired images, i2i translation is tackled with one or multiple domain transformations (i.e., CycleGAN, StarGAN etc.). In this paper, we study a new problem, that of image-to-image translation, under a set of continuous parameters that correspond to a model describing a physical process. In particular, we propose the SliderGAN which transforms an input face image into a new one according to the continuous values of a statistical blendshape model of facial motion. We show that it is possible to edit a facial image according to expression and speech blendshapes, using sliders that control the continuous values of the blendshape model. This provides much more flexibility in various tasks, including but not limited to face editing, expression transfer and face neutralisation, comparing to models based on discrete expressions or action units. "
We give a formal account of B\'enabou's theorem for peudoadjunctions in the context of Gray-categories. We prove that to give a pseudoadjunction $F \dashv U: A \to X$ with unit $\eta$ in a Gray-category K is precisely to give an absolute left (Kan) pseudoextension $U$ of $1_X$ along $F$ witnessed by $\eta$. 
"We show that Massive Black Holes of AGNs follow the same approximately linear relation with the luminosity of the host spheroid (bulge) found in normal (quiescent) galaxies, with the black hole mass being ~0.002 that of the bulge. We also demonstrate that Narrow line AGNs seem to have a significantly lower Mbh/Lbulge ratio, which implies a new strong correlation between Mbh/Lbulge and the width of the broad emission lines of AGNs. Combining existing data, new observations and extrapolation schemes based on the Faber-Jackson relation, the relation between the BH mass and the stellar velocity dispersion in the host bulge of AGNs is constructed. It too agrees with the relation found in quiescent galaxies. "
"The magnetic fields generated by spins and currents provide a unique window into the physics of correlated-electron materials and devices. Proposed only a decade ago, magnetometry based on the electron spin of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond is emerging as a platform that is excellently suited for probing condensed matter systems: it can be operated from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature, has a dynamic range spanning from DC to GHz, and allows sensor-sample distances as small as a few nanometres. As such, NV magnetometry provides access to static and dynamic magnetic and electronic phenomena with nanoscale spatial resolution. Pioneering work focused on proof-of-principle demonstrations of its nanoscale imaging resolution and magnetic field sensitivity. Now, experiments are starting to probe the correlated-electron physics of magnets and superconductors and to explore the current distributions in low-dimensional materials. In this Review, we discuss the application of NV magnetometry to the exploration of condensed matter physics, focusing on its use to study static and dynamic magnetic textures, and static and dynamic current distributions.

"Throughout 2017, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observed the northern far-ultraviolet aurorae of Saturn at northern solstice, during the Cassini Grand Finale. These conditions provided a complete viewing of the northern auroral region from Earth and a maximal solar illumination, expected to maximize the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling. In this study, we analyze 24 HST images concurrently with Cassini measurements of Saturn's Kilometric Radiation and solar wind parameters predicted by two MHD models. The aurorae reveal highly variable components, down to timescales of minutes, radiating 7 to 124 +/-11 GW. They include a nightside-shifted main oval, unexpectedly frequent and bright cusp emissions and a dayside low latitude oval. On average, these emissions display a strong Local Time dependence with two maxima at dawn and pre-midnight, the latter being newly observed and attributed to nightside injections possibly associated with solstice conditions. These results provide a reference frame to analyze Cassini in situ measurements, whether simultaneous or not. "
"We present an improved algorithm for the computation of Zariski chambers on algebraic surfaces. The new algorithm significantly outperforms the so far available method and allows therefore to treat surfaces of high Picard number, where huge chamber numbers occur. As an application, we efficiently compute the number of chambers supported by the lines on the Segre-Schur quartic. "
Lyapunov's second theorem is an essential tool for stability analysis of differential equations. The paper provides an analog theorem for incremental stability analysis by lifting the Lyapunov function to the tangent bundle. The Lyapunov function endows the state-space with a Finsler structure. Incremental stability is inferred from infinitesimal contraction of the Finsler metrics through integration along solutions curves. 
"This paper presents a heuristic method that uses information in the Japanese text along with knowledge of English countability and number stored in transfer dictionaries to determine the countability and number of English noun phrases. Incorporating this method into the machine translation system ALT-J/E, helped to raise the percentage of noun phrases generated with correct use of articles and number from 65% to 73%. "
"Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge in a teacher-student framework, by providing the predictions of the teacher network to the student network in the training stage to help the student network generalize better. It can use either a teacher with high capacity or {an} ensemble of multiple teachers. However, the latter is not convenient when one wants to use feature-map-based distillation methods. For a solution, this paper proposes a versatile and powerful training algorithm named FEature-level Ensemble for knowledge Distillation (FEED), which aims to transfer the ensemble knowledge using multiple teacher networks. We introduce a couple of training algorithms that transfer ensemble knowledge to the student at the feature map level. Among the feature-map-based distillation methods, using several non-linear transformations in parallel for transferring the knowledge of the multiple teacher{s} helps the student find more generalized solutions. We name this method as parallel FEED, andexperimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that our method has clear performance enhancements, without introducing any additional parameters or computations at test time. We also show the experimental results of sequentially feeding teacher's information to the student, hence the name sequential FEED, and discuss the lessons obtained. Additionally, the empirical results on measuring the reconstruction errors at the feature map give hints for the enhancements. "
"The enumeration of normal surfaces is a key bottleneck in computational three-dimensional topology. The underlying procedure is the enumeration of admissible vertices of a high-dimensional polytope, where admissibility is a powerful but non-linear and non-convex constraint. The main results of this paper are significant improvements upon the best known asymptotic bounds on the number of admissible vertices, using polytopes in both the standard normal surface coordinate system and the streamlined quadrilateral coordinate system. To achieve these results we examine the layout of admissible points within these polytopes. We show that these points correspond to well-behaved substructures of the face lattice, and we study properties of the corresponding ""admissible faces"". Key lemmata include upper bounds on the number of maximal admissible faces of each dimension, and a bijection between the maximal admissible faces in the two coordinate systems mentioned above. "
"We study a hypercyclicity property of linear dynamical systems: a bounded linear operator T acting on a separable infinite-dimensional Banach space X is said to be hypercyclic if there exists a vector x in X such that {T^{n}x : n>0} is dense in X, and frequently hypercyclic if there exists x in X such that for any non empty open subset U of X, the set {n>0 ; T^n x \in U} has positive lower density. We prove that if T is a bounded operator on X which has ""sufficiently many"" eigenvectors associated to eigenvalues of modulus 1 in the sense that these eigenvectors are perfectly spanning, then T is automatically frequently hypercyclic. "
"We discuss a spacetime having the topology of $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$ but with a different smoothness structure. The initial state of the cosmos in our model is identified with a wildly embedded 3-sphere (or a fractal space). In previous work we showed that a wild embedding is obtained by a quantization of a usual (or tame) embedding. Then a wild embedding can be identified with a (geometrical) quantum state. During a decoherence process this wild 3-sphere is changed to a homology 3-sphere. We are able to calculate the decoherence time for this process. After the formation of the homology 3-sphere, we obtain a spacetime with an accelerated expansion enforced by a cosmological constant. The calculation of this cosmological constant gives a qualitative agreement with the current measured value. "
"We discuss existence and classification of totally umbilic surfaces in the model geometries of Thurston and the Berger spheres. We classify such surfaces in $H^2 \times R$, $S^2 \times R$ and the Sol group. We prove nonexistence in the Berger spheres and in the remaining model geometries other than the space forms. "
"Since the discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in oxy-pnictide LaFeAsO1-xFx, enormous interests have been stimulated in the field of condensed matter physics and material sciences. Among the many kind of structures in the iron pnictide superconductors, FeSe with the PbO structure has received special attention since there is not poisonous pnictogen element in chemical composition and its structure is the simplest one. However, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in iron chalcogenide compounds is not enhanced as high as other iron pnictide superconductors under ambient pressure until the superconductivity at above 30 K in potassium intercalated iron selenide KxFe2-ySe2 was discovered. The insulating and the superconducting state are both observed in KxFe2-ySe2 with different stoichiometries and some groups have tuned the system from insulating to superconducting state by varying the ratio of starting materials[10, 11]. The recent data from neutron scattering suggest that the superconductivity may be built upon an ordered state of Fe vacancies as well as the antiferromagnetic state with a very strong ordered magnetic moment 3.4 B. Here we show that the superconductivity can actually be tuned on a single sample directly from an insulating state by post-annealing and fast quenching. Upon waiting for some days at room temperatures, the superconductivity will disappear and the resistivity exhibits an insulating behavior again. The spatial distribution of the compositions of the as-grown sample and the post-annealed-quenched one was analyzed by the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrum (EDXS) and found to be very close to each other. Therefore it is tempting to conclude that the superconductivity is achieved when the Fe-vacancies are in a random (disordered) state. Once they arrange in an ordered state by relaxation or slow cooling, the system turns out to be an insulator. "
"WZ Sge-type dwarf novae are characterized by long recurrence times of outbursts (~10 yr) and short orbital periods (<~ 85 min). A significant part of WZ Sge stars may remain undiscovered because of low outburst activity. Recently, the observed orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has changed partly because outbursts of new WZ Sge stars have been discovered routinely. Hence, the estimation of the intrinsic population of WZ Sge stars is important for the study of the population and evolution of CVs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach to estimate the intrinsic period distribution of dwarf novae from observed samples. In this Bayesian model, we assumed a simple relationship between the recurrence time and the orbital period which is consistent with observations of WZ Sge stars and other dwarf novae. As a result, the minimum orbital period was estimated to be ~70 min. The population of WZ Sge stars exhibited a spike-like feature at the shortest period regime in the orbital period distribution. These features are consistent with the orbital period distribution previously predicted by population synthesis studies. We propose that WZ Sge stars and CVs with a low mass-transfer rate are excellent candidates for the missing population predicted by the evolution theory of CVs. "
"We consider the scattering matrix approach to quantum electron transport in meso- and nano-conductors. This approach is an alternative to the more conventional kinetic equation and Green's function approaches, and often is more efficient for coherent conductors (especially for proving general relations) and typically more transparent. We provide a description of both time-averaged quantities (for example, current-voltage characteristics) and current fluctuations in time -- noise, as well as full counting statistics of charge transport in a finite time. In addition to normal conductors, we consider contacts with superconductors and Josephson junctions. "
"A method to simulate orthotropic behaviour in thin shell finite elements is proposed. The approach is based on the transformation of shape function derivatives, resulting in a new orthogonal basis aligned to a specified preferred direction for all elements. This transformation is carried out solely in the undeformed state leaving minimal additional impact on the computational effort expended to simulate orthotropic materials compared to isotropic, resulting in a straightforward and highly efficient implementation. This method is implemented for rotation-free triangular shells using the finite element framework built on the Kirchhoff--Love theory employing subdivision surfaces. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated using the deformation of a pinched hemispherical shell (with a 18{\deg} hole) standard benchmark. To showcase the efficiency of this implementation, the wrinkling of orthotropic sheets under shear displacement is analyzed. It is found that orthotropic subdivision shells are able to capture the wrinkling behavior of sheets accurately for coarse meshes without the use of an additional wrinkling model. "
"We propose a novel algorithm for testing the hypothesis of nonstationarity in complex-valued signals. The implementation uses both the bootstrap and the Fast Fourier Transform such that the algorithm can be efficiently implemented in O(NlogN) time, where N is the length of the observed signal. The test procedure examines the second-order structure and contrasts the observed power variance - i.e. the variability of the instantaneous variance over time - with the expected characteristics of stationary signals generated via the bootstrap method. Our algorithmic procedure is capable of learning different types of nonstationarity, such as jumps or strong sinusoidal components. We illustrate the utility of our test and algorithm through application to turbulent flow data from fluid dynamics. "
"We investigate system-environment correlations based on the exact dynamics of a qubit and its environment in the framework of pure decoherence (phase damping). We focus on the relation of decoherence and the build-up of system-reservoir entanglement for an arbitrary (possibly mixed) initial qubit state. In the commonly employed regime where the qubit dynamics can be described by a Markov master equation of Lindblad type, we find that for almost all qubit initial states inside the Bloch sphere, decoherence is complete while the total state is still separable - no entanglement is involved. In general, both ""separable"" and ""entangling"" decoherence occurs, depending on temperature and initial qubit state. Moreover, we find situations where classical and quantum correlations periodically alternate as a function of time in the regime of low temperatures. "
"The method of solving of nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation is considered. Some examples of its applications are demonstrated. "
"We prove that the obstruction bundle used to define the cup-product in Chen-Ruan cohomology is determined by the so-called `age grading' or `degree-shifting numbers'. Indeed, the obstruction bundle can be directly computed using the age grading. We obtain a Kunneth Theorem for Chen-Ruan cohomology as a direct consequence of an elementary property of the age grading, and explain how several other results - including associativity of the cup-product - can be proved in a similar way. "
"Segmentation of the airway tree from chest computed tomography (CT) images is critical for quantitative assessment of airway diseases including bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, obtaining an accurate segmentation of airways from CT scans is difficult due to the high complexity of airway structures. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art for many segmentation tasks, and in particular the so-called Unet architecture for biomedical images. However, its application to the segmentation of airways still remains a challenging task. This work presents a simple but robust approach based on a 3D Unet to perform segmentation of airways from chest CTs. The method is trained on a dataset composed of 12 CTs, and tested on another 6 CTs. We evaluate the influence of different loss functions and data augmentation techniques, and reach an average dice coefficient of 0.8 between the ground-truth and our automated segmentations. "
"We propose a new experiment for decay pion spectroscopy of light hypernuclei at electron- and proton-beam facilities, using the recoil distance technique for separation of produced hypernuclei and a magnetic spectrometer for precise measurement of the decay pion momentum. Low-pressure MWPCs are advocated for low-energy recoil detection as they provide position and time information and are highly insensitive to gamma-ray and electron background. The position and timing characteristics of such a recoil detector were studied using ~5 MeV {\alpha}-particles. By using the present proposed approach the rate of the detected hypernuclei can be increased by one-to-two orders of magnitude compared to a recent experiment carried out at the MAMI electron accelerator in Mainz. The possibility of realizing a high luminosity decay pion spectroscopy experiment with proton beams is also discussed. "
"The ecological principle of limiting similarity dictates that species similar in resource requirements will compete, with the superior eventually excluding the inferior competitor from the community. The observation that nonetheless apparently similar species comprise a significant proportion of the diversity in any given community has led to suggestions that competition may not in fact be an important regulator of community structure and assembly. Here we apply a recently introduced metric of species interaction, fractional (relative) abundance, to tree species of the tropical wet forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panam\'a, the particular community that inspired the original model of non-niche or 'neutral' community dynamics9. We show a distribution of fractional abundances between pairs of most closely related congeneric tree species differing from that expected of competitive exclusion, but also inconsistent with expectations of simple similarity, whether such species interchangeability (a fundamental requirement of neutrality) is inferred at the community or the pair level. Similar evidence from a strikingly different dry forest has been linked to the focused, stable competition of a temporal niche dynamic. Taken together with these earlier findings, the results reported here establish a potentially widespread and important role for species interaction in the diversity and maintenance of natural communities that must be considered when inferring process from pattern. "
"A review of the current status of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix (CKM) is presented. This paper is an update of the results published in [1]. The experimental constraints imposed by the measurements of \epsilon_K, V_{ub}/V_{cb}, \Delta m_d and from the limit on \Delta m_d are used. Values of the constraints and of the parameters entering into the constraints, which restrict the range of the \bar{\rho} and \bar{\eta} parameters, include recent measurements presented at 1998 Summer Conferences and progress obtained by lattice QCD collaborations. The results are: \bar{\rho}=0.202 ^{+0.053}_{-0.059},\bar{\eta}=0.340 \pm 0.035, from which the angles \alpha, \beta and \gamma of the unitarity triangle are inferred : \sin 2 \alpha = -0.26 ^{+ 0.29}_{-0.28} ,\sin 2 \beta = 0.725 ^{+0.050}_{-0.060} ,\gamma= (59.5^{+8.5}_{-7.5})^{\circ}. Without using the constraint from \epsilon_K, \sin 2 \beta has been obtained: \sin 2 \beta = 0.72 ^{+0.07}_{-0.11}. Several external measurements or theoretical inputs have been removed, in turn, from the constraints and their respective probability density functions have been obtained. Central values and uncertainties on these quantities have been compared with actual measurements or theoretical evaluations. In this way it is possible to quantify the importance of the different measurements and the coherence of the Standard Model scenario for CP violation. An important result is that \Delta m_s is expected to be between [12.0-17.6] ps^{-1} with 68% C.L. and <20 ps^{-1} at 95% C.L. Finally relations between the CKM parameters and the quark masses are examined within a given model. "
"We first propose a generalization of the notion of Mathieu subspaces of associative algebras $\mathcal A$, which was introduced recently in [Z4] and [Z6], to $\mathcal A$-modules $\mathcal M$. The newly introduced notion in a certain sense also generalizes the notion of submodules. Related with this new notion, we also introduce the sets $\sigma(N)$ and $\tau(N)$ of stable elements and quasi-stable elements, respectively, for all $R$-subspaces $N$ of $\mathcal A$-modules $\mathcal M$, where $R$ is the base ring of $\mathcal A$. We then prove some general properties of the sets $\sigma(N)$ and $\tau(N)$. Furthermore, examples from certain modules of the quasi-stable algebras [Z6], matrix algebras over fields and polynomial algebras are also studied. "
"Recent work of Biedermann and R\""ondigs has translated Goodwillie's calculus of functors into the language of model categories. Their work focuses on symmetric multilinear functors and the derivative appears only briefly. In this paper we focus on understanding the derivative as a right Quillen functor to a new model category. This is directly analogous to the behaviour of Weiss's derivative in orthogonal calculus. The immediate advantage of this new category is that we obtain a streamlined and more informative proof that the n-homogeneous functors are classified by spectra with an action of the symmetric group on n objects. In a later paper we will use this new model category to give a formal comparison between the orthogonal calculus and Goodwillie's calculus of functors. "
"The self-assembly of nanocrystals enables new classes of materials whose properties are controlled by the periodicities of the assembly, as well as by the size, shape and composition of the nanocrystals. While self-assembly of spherical nanoparticles has advanced significantly in the last decade, assembly of rod-shaped nanocrystals has seen limited progress due to the requirement of orientational order. Here, the parameters critically relevant to self-assembly are systematically quantified using a combination of diffraction and theoretical modeling; these highlight the importance of kinetics on orientational order. Through drying-mediated self-assembly we achieve unprecedented control over orientational order (up to 96% vertically oriented rods on 1cm2 areas) on a wide range of substrates (ITO, PEDOT:PSS, Si3N4). This opens new avenues for nanocrystal-based devices competitive with thin film devices, as problems of granularity can be tackled through crystallographic orientational control over macroscopic areas. "
"Motivated mainly by the localization over an open bounded set $\Omega$ of $\mathbb R^n$ of solutions of the Schr\""odinger equations, we consider the Schr\""odinger equation over $\Omega$ with a very singular potential $V(x) \ge C d (x, \partial \Omega)^{-r}$ with $r\ge 2$ and a convective flow $\vec U$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a very weak solution of the equation, when the right hand side datum $f(x)$ is in $L^1 (\Omega, d(\cdot, \partial \Omega))$, even if no boundary condition is a priori prescribed. We prove that, in fact, the solution necessarily satisfies (in a suitable way) the Dirichlet condition $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$. These results improve some of the results of the previous paper by the authors in collaboration with Roger Temam. In addition, we prove some new results dealing with the $m$-accretivity in $L^1 (\Omega, d(\cdot, \partial \Omega)^ \alpha)$, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$, of the associated operator, the corresponding parabolic problem and the study of the complex evolution Schr\""odinger equation in $\mathbb R^n$. "
"Strong co-operative interactions occur between four different broken symmetries involving charge-ordering and bond distortions in the quarter-filled correlated zigzag electron ladder. The ground state is singlet, with spin gap several times larger than in the spin-Peierls state of the one-dimensional quarter-filled chain with the same parameters. We propose the quarter-filled zigzag electron ladder model for several different organic charge-transfer solids with coupled pairs of quasi-one-dimensional stacks, the spin-gap transition temperatures in which are unusually high. "
We show that the standard SU(n)-covariant Poisson sphere $S^{2n-1}$ is embedded in the nonstandard $SU(n+1)$-covariant Poisson complex projective spaces $CP^{n}$. 
"The origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is still unknown. At present, the major uncertainties are located at energies above $\sim 10^{19.5}$ eV, the expected beginning of the GZK suppression. This is mainly due to the low statistics available, a problem that will be addressed in unprecedented way by the upcoming orbital detectors like JEM-EUSO. The detection of very high energy photons is of great relevance for the understanding of the origin of this extreme energy cosmic rays (EECR), due to the astrophysical information content. However, their discrimination is an experimental challenge for current and future cosmic ray detectors. In this work we study the statistical separation between hadron and photon showers from space observations at energies where both, the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect and magnetospheric interactions are important for the development of the cascades. We base our analysis on the $X_{max}$ parameter, which is already a well known composition discrimination parameter for ground based fluorescence observatories. Our analysis applies to orbiting detectors in general. Nevertheless, we exemplify the practical utilization of our technique by estimating a general upper limit to the photon fraction in the integral flux, attainable by an ideal orbital detector with characteristics similar to JEM-EUSO. In the process we describe the resultant asymmetry in the photon-hadron discrimination efficiency in galactic coordinates. "
"We are concerned with viscous profiles (travelling waves and steady solutions) for mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems in one space variable. For a class of systems including the compressible Navier Stokes equation, these profiles satisfy a singular ordinary differential equation in the form \label{e:ab} dU / dt = F(U)/ z (U) . Here U takes values in $R^d$ and $F: R^d \to R^d$ is a regular function. The real valued function $z (U)$ is as well regular, but the equation is singular because $z (U)$ can attain the value 0. We focus on a small enough neighbourhood of a point $\bar U$ satisfying $F(\bar U) = \vec 0$, $z (\bar U) =0$. From the point of view of the applications to the study of hyperbolic-parabolic systems this means restricting to systems with small total variation. We discuss how to extend the notions of center manifold and of uniformly stable manifold. Also, we give conditions ensuring that if $z (U) \neq 0$ at $t=0$ then $z (U) \neq 0$ at every $t$. We provide an example showing that if $z(U)$ becomes zero in finite time then in general the solution $U$ of equation \eqref{e:ab} is not continuously differentiable. "
"Let $\alpha, \beta \geq 0$ and $\alpha + \beta < 1$. In this short note, we show that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} p_n^\beta(p_{n+1}^\alpha - p_n^\alpha) = 0$, where $p_n$ is the $n$th prime. This notes an improvement over results of S\'{a}ndor and gives additional evidence towards a conjecture of Andrica. This follows directly from recent results on prime pairs from Maynard, Tao, Zhang. "
"We study the electronic energy spectra and wave functions on the square Fibonacci tiling, using an off-diagonal tight-binding model, in order to determine the exact nature of the transitions between different spectral behaviors, as well as the scaling of the total bandwidth as it becomes finite. The macroscopic degeneracy of certain energy values in the spectrum is invoked as a possible mechanism for the emergence of extended electronic Bloch wave functions as the dimension changes from one to two. "
"This paper presents a readout system designed for testing the prototype of Small-Strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC), which is one of the main detector technologies used for ATLAS New-Small-Wheel Upgrade. This readout system aims at testing one full-size sTGC quadruplet with cosmic muon triggers. "
"The advent of radioactive ion beam facilities and new detector technologies have opened up new possibilities to investigate the radioactive decays of highly unstable nuclei, in particular the proton emission, $\alpha$ decay and heavy cluster decays from neutron-deficient (or proton-rich) nuclei around the proton drip line. It turns out that these decay measurements can serve as a unique probe for studying the structure of the nuclei involved. On the theoretical side, the development in nuclear many-body theories and supercomputing facilities have also made it possible to simulate the nuclear clusterization and decays from a microscopic and consistent perspective. In this article we would like to review the current status of these structure and decay studies in heavy nuclei, regarding both experimental and theoretical opportunities. We then discuss in detail the recent progress in our understanding of the nuclear $\alpha$ formation probabilities in heavy nuclei and their indication on the underlying nuclear structure. "
"The process of diffusive shock acceleration relies on the efficacy with which hydromagnetic waves can scatter charged particles in the precursor of a shock. The growth of self-generated waves is driven by both resonant and non-resonant processes. We perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the non-resonant cosmic-ray driven instability, in which the unstable waves are excited beyond the linear regime. In a snapshot of the resultant field, particle transport simulations are carried out. The use of a static snapshot of the field is reasonable given that the Larmor period for particles is typically very short relative to the instability growth time. The diffusion rate is found to be close to, or below, the Bohm limit for a range of energies. This provides the first explicit demonstration that self-excited turbulence reduces the diffusion coefficient and has important implications for cosmic ray transport and acceleration in supernova remnants. "
We study a flat 3-brane in presence of a linear $k$ field with nonzero cosmological constant $\Lambda_{4}$. In this model the crossing of the phantom divide (PD) occurs when the $k$-essence energy density becomes negative. We show that in the high energy regime the effective equation of state has a resemblance of a modified Chaplygin gas while in the low energy regime it becomes linear. We find a scale factor that begins from a singularity and evolves to a de Sitter stable stage while other solutions have a super-accelerated regime and end with a big rip. We use the energy conditions to show when the effective equation of state of the brane-universe crosses the PD. 
"In this paper a new mathematical model is proposed for task scheduling and resource allocation in Grid systems. In this novel model, load balancing, starvation prevention and failing strategies are stated as the constraints and the solution is restricted with a predefined quality of service for users with different priorities. These strategies are defined by resource providers based on the amount of submitted jobs to Grid. To solve the proposed model, a modern approximate Auction-based algorithm is developed and it is implemented as a prototype of Grid simulator namely Multi-S-Grid. The results are illustrated on 18 different large-scale Grid systems with different random capabilities and different users. The outcomes reveal the reasonable performance of the proposed Auction-based algorithm to solve Grid system optimization models. "
"We have initiated a dedicated search for new CVs, selecting candidates on the base of their spectroscopic properties in the Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS), which lead up to now to the identification of 50 new CVs and a dozen good candidates. Using the HQS data of the previously known CVs for extensive tests of our selection scheme, we demonstrate that our survey should be very efficient in finding short period systems as long as they have emission lines with equivalent widths >=10 A. So far, orbital periods have been measured for 15 of the new CVs, with the surprising result that only two systems lie at or below the lower boundary of the period gap. This - somewhat preliminary - result is in uncomfortable disagreement with the predictions of the standard scenario of CV evolution. "
We study the space-times admitting a null conformal Killing-Yano tensor whose divergence defines a Killing vector. We analyze the similitudes and differences with the recently studied non null case (Gen. Relativ. Grav. (2015) {\bf 47} 1911). The results by Barnes concerning the Birkhoff theorem for the case of null orbits are analyzed and generalized. 
"We study the effect of focusing of the radially and azimuthally polarized vector beams on the spin angular momentum (SAM) density and Poynting vector of scattered waves from a Mie particle. Remarkably, the study reveals that the SAM density of the scattered field is solely transverse in nature for radially and azimuthally polarized incident vector beams; however the Poynting vector shows usual longitudinal character. We also demonstrate that the transverse SAM density can further be tuned with wavelength and focusing of the incident beam by exploiting the interference of different scattering modes. These results may stimulate further experimental technique of detecting the transverse spin and Belinfante's spin-momentum densities. "
"An intrinsic curvature model is investigated using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations on dynamically triangulated spherical surfaces of size upto N=4842 with two fixed-vertices separated by the distance 2L. We found a first-order transition at finite curvature coefficient \alpha, and moreover that the order of the transition remains unchanged even when L is enlarged such that the surfaces become sufficiently oblong. This is in sharp contrast to the known results of the same model on tethered surfaces, where the transition weakens to a second-order one as L is increased. The phase transition of the model in this paper separates the smooth phase from the crumpled phase. The surfaces become string-like between two point-boundaries in the crumpled phase. On the contrary, we can see a spherical lump on the oblong surfaces in the smooth phase. The string tension was calculated and was found to have a jump at the transition point. The value of \sigma is independent of L in the smooth phase, while it increases with increasing L in the crumpled phase. This behavior of \sigma is consistent with the observed scaling relation \sigma \sim (2L/N)^\nu, where \nu\simeq 0 in the smooth phase, and \nu=0.93\pm 0.14 in the crumpled phase. We should note that a possibility of a continuous transition is not completely eliminated. "
"Self-gravitating relativistic disks around black holes can form as transient structures in a number of astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star coalescences, as well as the core-collapse of massive stars. We explore the stability of such disks against runaway and non-axisymmetric instabilities using three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations in full general relativity using the THOR code. We model the disk matter using the ideal fluid approximation with a $\Gamma$-law equation of state with $\Gamma=4/3$. We explore three disk models around non-rotating black holes with disk-to-black hole mass ratios of 0.24, 0.17 and 0.11. Due to metric blending in our initial data, all of our initial models contain an initial axisymmetric perturbation which induces radial disk oscillations. Despite these oscillations, our models do not develop the runaway instability during the first several orbital periods. Instead, all of the models develop unstable non-axisymmetric modes on a dynamical timescale. We observe two distinct types of instabilities: the Papaloizou-Pringle and the so-called intermediate type instabilities. The development of the non-axisymmetric mode with azimuthal number m = 1 is accompanied by an outspiraling motion of the black hole, which significantly amplifies the growth rate of the m = 1 mode in some cases. Overall, our simulations show that the properties of the unstable non-axisymmetric modes in our disk models are qualitatively similar to those in Newtonian theory. "
"We report on long-term monitoring of anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Using phase-coherent timing, we find a wide variety of behaviors among the sources, ranging from high stability (in 1E 2259.1+586 and 4U 0142+61), to instabilities so severe that phase-coherent timing is not possible (in 1E 1048.1-5937). We note a correlation in which timing stability in AXPs decreases with increasing spin-down rate. The timing stability of soft gamma repeaters in quiescence is consistent with this trend, which is similar to one seen in radio pulsars. We consider high signal-to-noise ratio average pulse profiles as a function of energy for each AXP, and find a variety of behaviors. We find no large variability in pulse morphology nor in pulsed flux as a function of time. "
"We prove that under certain mild assumptions, the entropy rate of a hidden Markov chain, observed when passing a finite-state stationary Markov chain through a discrete-time continuous-output channel, is jointly analytic as a function of the input Markov chain parameters and the channel parameters. In particular, as consequences of the main theorems, we obtain analyticity for the entropy rate associated with representative channels: Cauchy and Gaussian. "
"We give a simple way to detect the geometric phase shift and the conditional geometric phase shift with Josephson junction system. Comparing with the previous work(Falcl G, Fazio R, Palma G.M., Siewert J and Verdal V, {\it Nature} {\bf 407}, 355(2000)), our scheme has two advantages. We use the non-adiabatic operation, thus the detection is less affected by the decoherence. Also, we take the time evolution on zero dynamic phase loop, we need not take any extra operation to cancel the dynamic phase. "
"Whether a spin-1/2 Fermi gas will become ferromagnetic as the strength of repulsive interaction increases is a long-standing controversial issue. Recently this problem is studied experimentally by Jo et al, Science, 325, 1521 (2009) in which the authors claim a ferromagnetic transition is observed. This work is to point out the results of this experiment can not distinguish whether the system is in a ferromagnetic state or in a non-magnetic but strongly short-range correlated state. A conclusive experimental demonstration of ferromagnetism relies on the observation of ferromagnetic domains. "
"This article presents a simple characterization for entangled vectors in a finite dimensional Hilbert space $H$. The characterization is in terms of the coefficients of an expansion of the vector relative to an orthonormal basis for $H$. This simple necessary and sufficient condition contains a restriction and we also present a more complicated condition that is completely general. Although these characterizations apply to bipartite systems, we show that generalizations to multipartite systems are also valid. "
"This paper investigates the detailed dynamical properties of a relatively homogeneous sample of disc-dominated S0 galaxies, with a view to understanding their formation, evolution and structure. By using high signal-to-noise ratio long-slit spectra of edge-on systems, we have been able to reconstruct the complete line-of-sight velocity distributions of stars along the galaxies' major axes. From these data, we have derived both model distribution functions (the phase density of their stars) and the approximate form of their gravitational potentials. The derived distribution functions are all consistent with these galaxies being simple disc systems, with no evidence for a complex formation history. Essentially no correlation is found between the characteristic mass scale-lengths and the photometric scale-lengths in these galaxies, suggesting that they are dark-matter dominated even in their inner parts. Similarly, no correlation is found between the mass scale-lengths and asymptotic rotation speed, implying a wide range of dark matter halo properties. By comparing their asymptotic rotation speeds with their absolute magnitudes, we find that these S0 galaxies are systematically offset from the Tully-Fisher relation for later-type galaxies. The offset in luminosity is what one would expect if star formation had been suddenly switched off a few Gyrs ago, consistent with a simple picture in which these S0s were created from ordinary later-type spirals which were stripped of their star-forming ISM when they encountered a dense cluster environment.

"We establish a link between Archimedes' method of integration for calculating areas, volumes and centers of mass of segments of parabolas and quadrics of revolution by factorization via the moments of a balance and an integration technique for a particular integrable system, namely Bianchi's B\""{a}cklund transformation for quadrics. "
"-Recent advances in microelectronics have enabled the realization of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). However , the massive growth in wireless devices and the push for interconnecting these devices to form an Internet of Things (IoT) can be challenging for WBANs; hence robust communication is necessary through careful medium access arbitration. In this paper, we propose a new protocol to enable WBAN operation within an IoT. Basically, we leverage the emerging Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) and promote the integration of a BLE transceiver and a Cognitive Radio module (CR) within the WBAN coordinator. Accordingly, a BLE informs WBANs through announcements about the frequency channels that are being used in their vicinity. To mitigate interference, the superframe's active period is extended to involve not only a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, but also a Flexible Channel Selection (FCS) and a Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC). With the help of CR, an IMC is selected for a WBAN and each interfering sensor will be allocated a time-slot within the (FBTDMA) frame to retransmit using such IMC. "
"We propose some new method of constructing configurations, which consists in consecutive inscribing copies of one underlying configuration. A uniform characterization of the obtained class and the one introduced in our paper untitled ""Multiplied configurations, series induced by correlations"", which makes use of some covering by family of closed substructures, is given. "
"We investigate the condition for capture into first-order mean motion resonances using numerical simulations with a wide range of various parameters. In particular, we focus on deriving the critical migration timescale for capture into the 2:1 resonance; additional numerical experiments for closely spaced resonances (e.g., 3:2) are also performed. We find that the critical migration timescale is determined by the planet-to-stellar mass ratio, and its dependence exhibits power-law behavior with index -4/3. This dependence is also supported by simple analytic arguments. We also find that the critical migration timescale for systems with equal-mass bodies is shorter than that in the restricted problem; for instance, for the 2:1 resonance between two equal-mass bodies, the critical timescale decreases by a factor of 10. In addition, using the obtained formula, the origin of observed systems that include first-order commensurabilities is constrained. Assuming that pairs of planets originally form well separated from each other and then undergo convergent migration and are captured in resonances, it is possible that a number of exoplanets experienced rapid orbital migration. For systems in closely spaced resonances, the differential migration timescale between the resonant pair can be constrained well; it is further suggested that several exoplanets underwent migration that can equal or even exceed the type I migration rate predicted by the linear theory. This implies that some of them may have formed in situ. Future observations and the use of our model will allow us to statistically determine the typical migration speed in a protoplanetary disk. "
In this paper we show that the tree class of a component of the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of a Frobenius-Lusztig kernel is one of the three infinite Dynkin diagrams. For the special case of the small quantum group we show that the periodic components are homogeneous tubes and that the non-periodic components have shape Z[A_\infty] if the component contains a module for the infinite-dimensional quantum group. 
"If the function $f$ is transcendental and meromorphic in the plane, and either $f$ has finitely many poles or its inverse function has a logarithmic singularity over infinity, then the equation $\dot z = f(z)$ has infinitely many trajectories tending to infinity in finite increasing time "
"In the following work we consider the possibility of explaining the observed baryon number asymmetry in the universe from simple baryon number violating modifications, involving massive scalar bosons, to the Standard Model. In these cases baryon number violation is mediated through a combination of Yukawa and scalar self-coupling interactions. Starting with a previously compiled catalogue of baryon-number violating extensions of the Standard Model, we identify the minimal subsets which can induce a $B-L$ asymmetry and thus be immune to sphaleron washout. For each of these models, we identify the region of parameter space that leads to the production of a baryon number asymmetry of the correct order of magnitude. "
"The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) offers a rich framework embedding physics beyond the Standard Model as well as consistent interpretations of the results about the Higgs signal detected at the LHC. We investigate the decays of neutral Higgs states into Standard Model (SM) fermions and gauge bosons. We perform full one-loop calculations of the decay widths and include leading higher-order QCD corrections. We first discuss the technical aspects of our approach, before confronting our predictions to those of existing public tools, performing a numerical analysis and discussing the remaining theoretical uncertainties. In particular, we find that the decay widths of doublet-dominated heavy Higgs bosons into electroweak gauge bosons are dominated by the radiative corrections, so that the tree-level approximations that are often employed in phenomenological analyses fail. Finally, we focus on the phenomenological properties of a mostly singlet-like state with a mass below the one at $125\,$GeV, a scenario that appears commonly within the NMSSM. In fact, the possible existence of a singlet-dominated state in the mass range around or just below $100\,$GeV would have interesting phenomenological implications. Such a scenario could provide an interpretation for both the $2.3\sigma$ local excess observed at LEP in the $e^+e^-\to Z(H\to b\bar{b})$ searches at $\sim 98\,$GeV and for the local excess in the diphoton searches recently reported by CMS in this mass range, while at the same time it would reduce the ""Little Hierarchy"" problem. "
"In this article, we obtain quasiconformal extensions of some classes of conformal maps defined either on the unit disc or on the exterior of it onto the extended complex plane. Some of these extensions have been obtained by constructing suitable Loewner chains and others have been obtained by applying a well-known result. "
"For a big class of commutative rings R every continuous R-automorphism of R[[X_1,...,X_n]] with the identity linear part is in the commutator subgroup of Aut(R[[X_1,...,X_n]]). An explicit bound for the number of the involved commutators and a K-theoretic interpretation of this result are provided. "
"After having reported the detection of X-rays emitted by the peculiar system HD5980, we assess here the origin of this high-energy emission from additional X-ray observations obtained with XMM-Newton. This research provides the first detection of apparently periodic X-ray emission from hot gas produced by the collision of winds in an evolved massive binary outside the Milky Way. It also provides the first X-ray monitoring of a Luminous Blue Variable only years after its eruption and shows that the dominant source of the X-rays is not associated with the ejecta. "
"ProbLog is a state-of-art combination of logic programming and probabilities; in particular ProbLog offers parameter learning through a variant of the EM algorithm. However, the resulting learning algorithm is rather slow, even when the data are complete. In this short paper we offer some insights that lead to orders of magnitude improvements in ProbLog's parameter learning speed with complete data. "
"We present a power spectral analysis of the Crab pulsar's timing noise, mainly using radio measurements from Jodrell Bank taken over the period 1982-1989. The power spectral analysis is complicated by nonuniform data sampling and the presence of a steep red power spectrum that can distort power spectra measurement by causing severe power ``leakage''. We develop a simple windowing method for computing red noise power spectra of uniformly sampled data sets and test it on Monte Carlo generated sample realizations of red power-law noise. We generalize time-domain methods of generating power-law red noise with even integer spectral indices to the case of noninteger spectral indices. The Jodrell Bank pulse phase residuals are dense and smooth enough that an interpolation onto a uniform time series is possible. A windowed power spectrum is computed revealing a periodic or nearly periodic component with a period of about 568 days and a 1/f^3 power-law noise component with a noise strength of 1.24 +/- 0.067 10^{-16} cycles^2/sec^2 over the analysis frequency range 0.003 - 0.1 cycles/day. This result deviates from past analyses which characterized the pulse phase timing residuals as either 1/f^4 power-law noise or a quasiperiodic process. The analysis was checked using the Deeter polynomial method of power spectrum estimation that was developed for the case of nonuniform sampling, but has lower spectral resolution. The timing noise is consistent with a torque noise spectrum rising with analysis frequency as f implying blue torque noise, a result not predicted by current models of pulsar timing noise. If the periodic or nearly periodic component is due to a binary companion, we find a companion mass > 3.2 Earth masses. "
"We introduce geomstats, a python package that performs computations on manifolds such as hyperspheres, hyperbolic spaces, spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices and Lie groups of transformations. We provide efficient and extensively unit-tested implementations of these manifolds, together with useful Riemannian metrics and associated Exponential and Logarithm maps. The corresponding geodesic distances provide a range of intuitive choices of Machine Learning loss functions. We also give the corresponding Riemannian gradients. The operations implemented in geomstats are available with different computing backends such as numpy, tensorflow and keras. We have enabled GPU implementation and integrated geomstats manifold computations into keras deep learning framework. This paper also presents a review of manifolds in machine learning and an overview of the geomstats package with examples demonstrating its use for efficient and user-friendly Riemannian geometry. "
"We analyze the quantum dynamics of radiation propagating in a single mode optical fiber with dispersion, nonlinearity, and Raman coupling to thermal phonons. We start from a fundamental Hamiltonian that includes the principal known nonlinear effects and quantum noise sources, including linear gain and loss. Both Markovian and frequency-dependent, non-Markovian reservoirs are treated. This allows quantum Langevin equations to be calculated, which have a classical form except for additional quantum noise terms. In practical calculations, it is more useful to transform to Wigner or +$P$ quasi-probability operator representations. These result in stochastic equations that can be analyzed using perturbation theory or exact numerical techniques. The results have applications to fiber optics communications, networking, and sensor technology. "
"We construct gauge theory of SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) by spectral cover from F-theory and ask how the Standard Model is extended under minimal assumptions on Higgs sector. For the requirement on different numbers between Higgs pairs and matter generations (respectively one and three) distinguished by R-parity, we choose a universal G-flux obeying SO(10) but slightly breaking E_6 unification relation. This condition forces distinction between up and down Higgs fields, suppression of proton decay operators up to dimension five, and existence and dynamics of a singlet related to mu-parameter. "
"In the Langevin formalism, the delicate balance maintained between the fluctuations in the system and their corresponding dissipation may be upset by the presence of a secondary, space-dependent stochastic force, particularly in the low friction regime. In prior work, the latter was dissipated self-consistently through an additional uniform (mean-field) friction [Shepherd and Hernandez, J. Chem. Phys., 115, 2430-2438 (2001).] An alternative approach to ensure that equipartition is satisfied relies on the use of a space-dependent friction while ignoring nonlocal correlations. The approach is evaluated with respect to its ability to maintain constant temperature for two simple one-dimensional, stochastic potentials of mean force wherein the friction can be evaluated explicitly when there is no memory in the barriers. The use of a space-dependent friction is capable of providing qualitatively similar results to those obtained previously, but in extreme cases, deviations from equipartition may be observed due to the neglect of the memory effects present in the stochastic potentials. "
"A human brain is capable of continual learning by nature; however the current mainstream deep neural networks suffer from a phenomenon named catastrophic forgetting (i.e., learning a new set of patterns suddenly and completely would result in fully forgetting what has already been learned). In this paper we propose a generic learning model, which regards a learning system as a fiber bundle. By comparing the learning performance of our model with conventional ones whose neural networks are multilayer perceptrons through a variety of machine-learning experiments, we found our proposed model not only enjoys a distinguished capability of continual learning but also bears a high information capacity. In addition, we found in some learning scenarios the learning performance can be further enhanced by making the learning time-aware to mimic the episodic memory in human brain. Last but not least, we found that the properties of forgetting in our model correspond well to those of human memory. This work may shed light on how a human brain learns. "
"We propose a new hypothesis for the origin of non-solar hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) at all energies: Highly relativistic, narrowly collimated jets from the birth or collapse of neutron stars (NSs) in our Galaxy accelerate ambient disk and halo matter to CR energies and disperse it in ``hot spots'' which they form when they stop in the Galactic halo. Such events - ``Galactic Gamma-Ray Bursters'' (GGRBs) - are proposed to cause cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in other galaxies when their beamed radiation happens to point in our direction. Our hypothesis naturally explains some observations which are difficult to understand with the currently popular ideas about CR origin - e.g. the small Galacto-centric gradient of the cosmic-ray density and the absence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. Our idea stands or falls with the existence of the ``hot spots'' (``GGRB remnants'') in the Galactic halo. We discuss their expected observational signatures and find that they could appear as EGRET unidentified high-latitude sources. "
"While the dynamics of many complex systems is dominated by activated events, there are very few simulation methods that take advantage of this fact. Most of these procedures are restricted to relatively simple systems or, as with the activation-relaxation technique (ART), sample the conformation space efficiently at the cost of a correct thermodynamical description. We present here an extension of ART, the properly-obeying-probability ART (POP-ART), that obeys detailed balance and samples correctly the thermodynamic ensemble. Testing POP-ART on two model systems, a vacancy and an interstitial in crystalline silicon, we show that this method recovers the proper thermodynamical weights associated with the various accessible states and is significantly faster than MD in the diffusion of a vacancy below 700 K. "
"The simplest version of the method of detection of single molecular scattering basing on the polarization measurements of the twilight sky background by all-sky cameras is considered. The method can be used during the transitive twilight (solar zenith angles 94-98 degrees), when effective single scattering takes place in upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. The application of the method to the multi-year measurements in the vicinity of Moscow and Apatity allows determination of temperature of these atmospheric layers and estimation of contribution and properties of multiple scattering during the transitive twilight period. "
"In this work we study theoretically the coupling of single molecule magnets (SMMs) to a variety of quantum circuits, including microwave resonators with and without constrictions and flux qubits. The main results of this study is that it is possible to achieve strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes between SMM crystals and the superconducting circuit, with strong hints that such a coupling could also be reached for individual molecules close to constrictions. Building on the resulting coupling strengths and the typical coherence times of these molecules (of the order of microseconds), we conclude that SMMs can be used for coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information, either in the context of quantum computing or in quantum simulations. Throughout the work we also discuss in detail the family of molecules that are most suitable for such operations, based not only on the coupling strength, but also on the typical energy gaps and the simplicity with which they can be tuned and oriented. Finally, we also discuss practical advantages of SMMs, such as the possibility to fabricate the SMMs ensembles on the chip through the deposition of small droplets. "
"We calculate the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ radiative corrections to the spin dependent differential decay rates of the process $t\rightarrow b+W^+$. These are needed to study the angular distribution of the energy of hadrons produced in polarized top quark decays at next-to-leading order (NLO). In our previous work, we studied the angular distribution of the scaled-energy of bottom-flavored hadrons (B) from polarized top quark decays, using a specific helicity coordinate system where the top quark spin was measured relative to the bottom momentum (system~1). Here, we study the angular distribution of the energy spectrum of B-hadron in a different helicity system, where the top spin is specified relative to the W-momentum (system~2). These energy distributions are governed by the polarized and unpolarized rate functions which are related to the density matrix elements of the decay $t\rightarrow W^++b$. Through this paper, we present our predictions of the B-hadron spectrum in the polarized and unpolarized top decay and shall compare the polarized results in two different helicity systems. These predictions can be used to determine the polarization states of top quarks and also provide direct access to the B-hadron fragmentation functions (FFs) and allow us to deepen our knowledge of the hadroniazation process. "
"We study in detail Hodge-Helmholtz decompositions in non-smooth exterior domains filled with inhomogeneous and anisotropic media. We show decompositions of alternating differential forms belonging to weighted Sobolev spaces into irrotational and solenoidal forms. These decompositions are essential tools, for example, in electro-magnetic theory for exterior domains. In the appendix we translate our results to the classical framework of vector analysis. "
"Measurements of the energy spectrum and of the vortex-density fluctuation spectrum in superfluid turbulence seem to contradict each other. Using a numerical model, we show that at each instance of time the total vortex line density can be decomposed into two parts: one formed by metastable bundles of coherent vortices, and one in which the vortices are randomly oriented. We show that the former is responsible for the observed Kolmogorov energy spectrum, and the latter for the spectrum of the vortex line density fluctuations. "
"It was pointed out in Crisan, Ghazali [2] that the error estimate for the cubature on Wiener space algorithm developed in Lyons, Victoir [11] requires an additional assumption on the drift. In this note we demonstrate that it is straightforward to adopt the analysis of Kusuoka [7] to obtain a general estimate without an additional assumptions on the drift. In the process we slightly sharpen the bounds derived in [7]. "
"The high-temperature phase of Yang-Mills theory in Landau gauge is studied using Dyson-Schwinger equations. The propagators of the gluon and the Faddeev-Popov ghosts are obtained at finite and infinite temperature, partially analytically. The results are in good agreement with lattice results. It is found that the infrared properties are only quantitatively affected by temperature. The confinement of at least soft gluons transverse to the heat bath is established, in accordance with the Kugo-Ojima and Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenarios. This is confirmed by investigating the corresponding Schwinger functions. The hard modes are nearly inert even at temperatures of the order of the phase transition temperature. In addition, the thermodynamic potential is analyzed and solutions for 3d-Yang-Mills theory are obtained. It is conjectured that Yang-Mills theory likely undergoes a first order phase transition, which changes a strongly interacting system into another. The phases differ mainly by the properties of the chromoelectric sector. "
"In a first historical part I shall give a detailed description of how Pauli discovered --before the advent of the new quantum mechanics -- his exclusion principle. The second part is devoted to the insight and results that have been obtained in more recent times in our understanding of the stability of matter in bulk, both for ordinary matter (like stones) and self-gravitating bodies. "
"We study a one-dimensional lattice random walk with an absorbing boundary at the origin and a movable partial reflector. On encountering the reflector, at site x, the walker is reflected (with probability r) to x-1 and the reflector is simultaneously pushed to x+1. Iteration of the transition matrix, and asymptotic analysis of the probability generating function show that the critical exponent delta governing the survival probability varies continuously between 1/2 and 1 as r varies between 0 and 1. Our study suggests a mechanism for nonuniversal kinetic critical behavior, observed in models with an infinite number of absorbing configurations. "
"It is well known that the category of covering projections (that is, locally constant objects) of a locally connected topos is equivalent to the classifying topos of a strict progroupoid (or, equivalently, a localic prodiscrete groupoid), the \emph{fundamental progroupoid}, and that this progroupoid represents first degree cohomology. In this paper we generalize these results to an arbitrary topos. The fundamental progroupoid is now a localic progroupoid, and can not be replaced by a localic groupoid. The classifying topos in not any more a Galois topos. Not all locally constant objects can be considered as covering projections. The key contribution of this paper is a novel definition of covering projection for a general topos, which coincides with the usual definition when the topos is locally connected. The results in this paper were presented in a talk at the Category Theory Conference, Vancouver July 2004. "
"There is no proof yet of convergence of Genetic Algorithms. We do not supply it too. Instead, we present some thoughts and arguments to convince the Reader, that Genetic Algorithms are essentially bound for success. For this purpose, we consider only the crossover operators, single- or multiple-point, together with selection procedure. We also give a proof that the soft selection is superior to other selection schemes. "
"The family of generalized Pseudo-Spectral Time Domain (including the Pseudo-Spectral Analytical Time Domain) Particle-in-Cell algorithms offers substantial versatility for simulating particle beams and plasmas, and well written codes using these algorithms run reasonably fast. When simulating relativistic beams and streaming plasmas in multiple dimensions, they are, however, subject to the numerical Cherenkov instability. Previous studies have shown that instability growth rates can be reduced substantially by modifying slightly the transverse fields as seen by the streaming particles . Here, we offer an approach which completely eliminates the fundamental mode of the numerical Cherenkov instability while minimizing the transverse field corrections. The procedure, numerically computed residual growth rates (from weaker, higher order instability aliases), and comparisons with WARP simulations are presented. In some instances, there are no numerical instabilities whatsoever, at least in the linear regime. "
"We consider QCD at very low temperatures and non-zero quark chemical potential from lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the two-color theory in a very small spatial volume (the attoscale). In this regime the quark number rises in discrete levels in qualitative agreement with what is found analytically at one loop on S3xS1 with radius R_S3 << 1/{\Lambda}_QCD. The detailed level degeneracy, however, cannot be accounted for using weak coupling arguments. At each rise in the quark number there is a corresponding spike in the Polyakov line, also in agreement with the perturbative results. In addition the quark number susceptibility shows a similar behaviour to the Polyakov line and appears to be a good indicator of a confinement-deconfinement type of transition. "
"Let $X$ be a set of $K$-rational points in $P^1 \times P^1$ over a field $K$ of characteristic zero, let $Y$ be a fat point scheme supported at $ X$, and let $R_Y$ be the bihomogeneus coordinate ring of $Y$. In this paper we investigate the module of Kaehler differentials $\Omega^1_{R_Y/K}$. We describe this bigraded $R_Y$-module explicitly via a homogeneous short exact sequence and compute its Hilbert function in a number of special cases, in particular when the support $X$ is a complete intersection or an almost complete intersection in $P^1 \times P^1$. Moreover, we introduce a Kaehler different for $Y$ and use it to characterize reduced fat point schemes in $P^1 \times P^1$ having the Cayley-Bacharach property. "
"We consider noise-assisted spike propagation in myelinated axons within a multi-compartment stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley model. The noise originates from a finite number of ion channels in each node of Ranvier. For the subthreshold internodal electric coupling, we show that (i) intrinsic noise removes the sharply defined threshold for spike propagation from node to node, and (ii) there exists an optimum number of ion channels which allows for the most efficient signal propagation and it corresponds to the actual physiological values. "
"In this paper, I construct a new test of conditional moment inequalities, which is based on studentized kernel estimates of moment functions with many different values of the bandwidth parameter. The test automatically adapts to the unknown smoothness of moment functions and has uniformly correct asymptotic size. The test has high power in a large class of models with conditional moment inequalities. Some existing tests have nontrivial power against n^{-1/2}-local alternatives in a certain class of these models whereas my method only allows for nontrivial testing against (n/\log n)^{-1/2}-local alternatives in this class. There exist, however, other classes of models with conditional moment inequalities where the mentioned tests have much lower power in comparison with the test developed in this paper. "
"The article presents the results of experiments in computation of statistical values related to Young diagrams, including the estimates on maximum and average (by Plancherel distribution) dimension of irreducible representation of symmetric group $S_n$. The computed limit shapes of two-dimensional and three-dimensional diagrams distributed by Richardson statistics are presented as well. "
"We answer a question of Alon, Mossel, and Pemantle about the corruption detection model on graphs in the noisy setting. "
"Magnetic and dielectric properties of the hexagonal triangular lattice antiferromagnet 2H-AgFeO2 have been studied by neutron diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, pyroelectric current, and dielectric constant measurements. The ferroelectric polarization, P ~ 5 {\mu}C/m2, has been found to appear below 11 K due to a polar nature of the magnetic ground state of the system. In the temperature range of 11 K < T < 18 K, an incommensurate spin density wave (ICM1) with the nonpolar magnetic point group mmm1' and the k1 = (0,q1_b,0; q1_b = 0.390-0.405)propagation vector takes place. Below 14 K, a proper screw ordering (ICM2) and k2 = (0,q2_b,0; q2_b = 0.385-0.396) appears as a minor phase which coexists with ICM1 and the ground state down to the lowestmeasured temperature 5.5 K. No ferroelectric polarization associated with the ICM2 phase was observed in agreement with its nonpolar point group 2221'. Finally, a spiral order with cycloid and proper screw components (ICM3), and k3 = (q3_a,q3_b,0; q3_a = 0.0467, q3_b = 0.349) emerges below 11 K as the ground state of the system. Based on the deduced magnetic point group 21', we conclude that the ferroelectric polarization in ICM3 is parallel to the c axis and is caused by the inverse Dzyloshinskii-Moriya effect with p1 ~ rij x (Si x Sj ). Unlike the rhombohedral 3R-AgFeO2 polytype, the additional contribution to the macroscopic polarization p2 ~ Si x Sj is not allowed in the present case due to the symmetry constraints imposed by the hexagonal lattice of 2H-AgFeO2.

"Accretion onto magnetized neutron stars is expected to be centrifugally inhibited at low accretion rates. Several sources, however, are known to pulsate in quiescence at luminosities below the theoretical limit predicted for the onset of the centrifugal barrier. The source 1A 0535+262 is one of them. Here we present the results of an analysis of a ~50 ks long XMM-Newton observation of 1A 0535+262 in quiescence. At the time of the observation, the neutron star was close to apastron, and the source had remained quiet for two orbital cycles. In spite of this, we detected a pulsed X-ray flux of ~3e-11 erg/cm2/s . Several observed properties, including the power spectrum, remained similar to those observed in the outbursts. Particularly, we have found that the frequency of the break detected in the quiescent noise power spectrum follows the same correlation with flux observed when the source is in outburst. This correlation has been associated with the truncation of the accretion disk at the magnetosphere boundary. We argue that our result, along with other arguments previously reported in the literature, suggests that the accretion in quiescence also proceeds from an accretion disk around the neutron star. The proposed scenario consistently explains the energy of the cyclotron line observed in 1A 0535+262, and the timing properties of the source including the spin frequency evolution within and between the outbursts, and the frequency of the break in power spectrum.

"Magic numbers predicted by a 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator with Uq(3)>SOq(3) symmetry are compared to experimental data for atomic clusters of alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au), divalent metals (Zn, Cd), and trivalent metals (Al, In), as well as to theoretical predictions of jellium models, Woods-Saxon and wine bottle potentials, and to the classification scheme using the 3n+l pseudo quantum number. In alkali metal clusters and noble metal clusters the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator correctly predicts all experimentally observed magic numbers up to 1500 (which is the expected limit of validity for theories based on the filling of electronic shells), while in addition it gives satisfactory results for the magic numbers of clusters of divalent metals and trivalent metals, thus indicating that Uq(3), which is a nonlinear extension of the U(3) symmetry of the spherical (3-dimensional isotropic) harmonic oscillator, is a good candidate for being the symmetry of systems of several metal clusters. The Taylor expansions of angular momentum dependent potentials approximately producing the same spectrum as the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator are found to be similar to the Taylor expansions of the symmetrized Woods-Saxon and wine-bottle symmetrized Woods-Saxon potentials, which are known to provide successful fits of the Ekardt potentials. "
"We investigate the decays of $\bar{B}^0_s$, $\bar{B}^0$ and $B^-$ into $\eta_c$ plus a scalar meson in a theoretical framework by taking into account the dominant process for the weak decay of $\bar{B}$ meson into $\eta_c$ and a $q\bar{q}$ pair. After hadronization of this $q\bar{q}$ component into pairs of pseudoscalar mesons we obtain certain weights for the pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson components. The calculation is based on the postulation that the scalar mesons $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ are dynamically generated states from the pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interactions in $S$-wave. Up to a global normalization factor, the $\pi \pi$, $K \bar{K}$ and $\pi \eta$ invariant mass distributions for the decays of $\bar B^0_s \to \eta_c \pi^+ \pi^-$, $\bar{B}^0_s \to \eta_c K^+ K^-$, $\bar B^0 \to \eta_c \pi^+ \pi^-$, $\bar{B}^0 \to \eta_c K^+ K^-$, $\bar{B}^0 \to \eta_c \pi^0 \eta$, $B^- \to \eta_c K^0 K^-$ and $B^- \to \eta_c \pi^- \eta$ are predicted. Comparison is made with the limited experimental information available and other theoretical calcualtions. Further comparison of these results with coming LHCb measurements will be very valuable to make progress in our understanding of the nature of the low lying scalar mesons, $f_0(500), f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$.

We calculate the masses of the $1^{-+}$ four quark states which decay dominantly into $\rho\pi$ and $\eta\pi$ respectively by QCD sum rules approach. We include the zero mode contribution and find it plays an important role in the sum rules. We predict that the masses of the states $\eta\pi$ and $\rho\pi$ both are 1.4-1.5 GeV. This is close to the experimental candidates $\pi_1(1370)$ and $\pi_1(1440)$. 
"Cell movement and intercellular signaling occur simultaneously during the development of tissues, but little is known about how movement affects signaling. Previous theoretical studies have shown that faster moving cells favor synchronization across a population of locally coupled genetic oscillators. An important assumption in these studies is that cells can immediately interact with their new neighbors after arriving at a new location. However, intercellular interactions in cellular systems may need some time to become fully established. How movement affects synchronization in this situation has not been examined. Here we develop a coupled phase oscillator model in which we consider cell movement and the gradual recovery of intercellular coupling experienced by a cell after movement, characterized by a moving rate and a coupling recovery rate respectively. We find (1) an optimal moving rate for synchronization, and (2) a critical moving rate above which achieving synchronization is not possible. These results indicate that the extent to which movement enhances synchrony is limited by a gradual recovery of coupling. These findings suggest that the ratio of time scales of movement and signaling recovery is critical for information transfer between moving cells. "
"In this note I describe the structure of the biset functor $B^\times$ sending a $p$-group $P$ to the group of units of its Burnside ring $B(P)$. In particular, I show that $B^\times$ is a rational biset functor. It follows that if $P$ is a $p$-group, the structure of $B^\times(P)$ can be read from a genetic basis of $P$: the group $B^\times(P)$ is an elementary abelian 2-group of rank equal to the number isomorphism classes of rational irreducible representations of $P$ whose type is trivial, cyclic of order 2, or dihedral.

"We present a comprehensive computational study of some 900 possible ""lambda-lac"" mutants of the lysogeny maintenance switch in phage lambda, of which up to date 19 have been studied experimentally (Atsumi & Little, PNAS 103: 4558-4563, (2006)). We clarify that these mutants realise regulatory schemes quite different from wild-type lambda, and can therefore be expected to behave differently, within the conventional mechanistic setting in which this problem has often been framed. We verify that indeed, within this framework, across this wide selection of mutants the lambda-lac mutants for the most part either have no stable lytic states, or should only be inducible with difficulty. In particular, the computational results contradicts the experimental finding that four lambda-lac mutants both show stable lysogeny and are inducible. This work hence suggests either that the four out of 900 mutants are special, or that lambda lysogeny and inducibility are holistic effects involving other molecular players or other mechanisms, or both. The approach illustrates the power and versatility of computational systems biology to systematically and quickly test a wide variety of examples and alternative hypotheses for future closer experimental studies.

"Context. Scattering and absorption processes in stellar atmosphere affect the center-to-limb variations of the intensity (CLVI) and the linear polarization (CLVP) of stellar radiation. Aims. There are several theoretical and observational studies of CLVI using different stellar models, however, most studies of CLVP have concentrated on the solar atmosphere and have not considered the CLVP in cooler non-gray stellar atmospheres at all. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the CLV of the intensity and the linear polarization in continuum spectra of different spectral type stars. Methods. We solve the radiative transfer equations for polarized light iteratively assuming no magnetic field and considering a plane-parallel model atmospheres and various opacities. Results. We calculate the CLVI and the CLVP for Phoenix stellar model atmospheres for the range of effective temperatures (4500K - 6900K), gravities (log g = 3.0 - 5.0), and wavelengths (4000 - 7000 {\AA}), which are tabulated and available at the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center (CDS). In addition, we present several tests of our code and compare our results with measurements and calculations of CLVI and the CLVP for the Sun. The resulting CLVI are fitted with polynomials and their coefficients are presented in this paper. Conclusions. For the stellar model atmospheres with lower gravity and effective temperature the CLVP is larger. "
"Resonance spectral lines such as H I Ly {\alpha}, Mg II h&k, and Ca II H&K that form in the solar chromosphere are influenced by the effects of 3D radiative transfer as well as partial redistribution (PRD). So far no one has modeled these lines including both effects simultaneously owing to the high computing demands of existing algorithms. Such modeling is however indispensable for accurate diagnostics of the chromosphere. We present a computationally tractable method to treat PRD scattering in 3D model atmospheres using a 3D non-LTE radiative transfer code. To make the method memory-friendly, we use the hybrid approximation of Leenaarts et al. (2012) for the redistribution integral. To make it fast, we use linear interpolation on equidistant frequency grids. We verify our algorithm against computations with the RH code and analyze it for stability, convergence, and usefulness of acceleration using model atoms of Mg II with the h&k lines and H I with the Ly {\alpha} line treated in PRD. A typical 3D PRD solution can be obtained in a model atmosphere with $252 \times 252 \times 496$ coordinate points in 50 000--200 000 CPU hours, which is a factor ten slower than computations assuming complete redistribution. We illustrate the importance of the joint action of PRD and 3D effects for the Mg II h&k lines for disk-center intensities as well as the center-to-limb variation. The proposed method allows simulating PRD lines in time series of radiation-MHD models in order to interpret observations of chromospheric lines at high spatial resolution. "
"The variation ranges of the axial B_{k0} crystal-field parameters, for k=2,4,6, of tetragonal including cubic crystal-field Hamiltonians H_{CF} for all possible orientations of the relevant reference frame are studied. The distinguished z-axis directions fixed by the maximal absolute values of B_{k0} are analyzed. The diagrams for any tetragonal H_{CF} parametrization depicting the maximal values of |B_{k0}|/M_{k}, where M_{k} is the 2^{k}-pole modulus, as a function of the x=B_{k4}/B_{k0} or B_{64}/B_{60} ratios, together with the distinguished directions are presented. The max|B_{k0}|/M_{k} magnitudes and the relevant distinguished directions are the discriminants of all the equivalent parametrizations. They vary within the intervals (0.7395,1], (0.6074,1] for tetragonal k=4 and tetragonal k=6 H_{CF} components, respectively. Such specified directions determine the mutual spatial orientation of the component 2^{k}-poles of the H_{CF}, and due to their rigid coupling in the H_{CF}, they also refer to the global H_{CF} parametrization. This approach demonstrates the difference in fitting capability between the real and complex isomodular H_{CF} parametrizations. "
"The existence of antimatter domains in baryon asymmetrical Universe can appear as the cosmological consequence of particle theory in inflationary models with non-homogeneous baryosynthesis. Such a domain can survive in the early Universe and form globular cluster of antimatter stars in our Galaxy. The model of antimatter pollution of Galaxy and annihilation with matter gas is developed. The proton-antiproton annihilation gamma flux is shown to reproduce the observed galactic gamma background measured by EGRET. From comparison with observational data the estimation on the maximally allowed amount of antimatter stars, possibly present in our Galaxy, is found. "
"It is generally accepted today that our solar system has undergone a phase during which the orbits of the giant planets became very unstable. In recent years, many studies have identified traces of this event and have provided reasonable justification for this occurrence. The magnitude (in terms of orbital variation) and the timing of the instability though (early or late with respect to the dispersal of the gas disk) still remains an open debate. The terrestrial planets seem to set a strict constraint: either the giant planet instability happened early, while the terrestrial planets were still forming, or the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn had to separate from each other impulsively, with a large enough `jump' in semimajor axis (Brasser et al. 2009; Kaib and Chambers 2016) for the terrestrial planets to remain stable. Because a large orbital jump is a low probability event, the early instability hypothesis seems to be favored. However, the asteroid belt would also evolve in a different way, assuming different instability amplitudes. These two constraints need to match each other in order to favor one scenario over the other. Considering an initially dynamically cold disk of asteroids, Morbidelli et al. (2010) concluded that a comparably large jump is needed to reconstruct the current asteroid belt. Here we confirm the same conclusion, but considering an asteroid population already strongly excited in eccentricity, such as that produced in the Grand Tack scenario (Walsh et al. 2011). Because the asteroids existed since the time of removal of the gas disk, unlike the terrestrial planets, this constraint on the width of the giant planet jump is valid regardless of whether the instability happened early or late. Hence, at this stage, assuming an early instability does not appear to provide any advantage in terms of the probabilistic reconstruction of the solar system structure. "
"The evolution of stars born with a convective core is highly dependent on the efficiency and extent of near core mixing processes, which effectively increases both the core mass and main-sequence lifetime. We investigate to what extent gravity-mode period spacings in slowly pulsating B-type stars observed by the Kepler mission can be used to constrain both the shape and extent of convective core overshoot and additional mixing in the radiative envelope. We compute grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for two different shapes of convective core overshooting and three shapes of radiative envelope mixing. The models in these grids are compared to a set of benchmark models to evaluate their capability of mimicking the dipole prograde g-modes of the benchmark models. Through our model comparisons we find that at a central hydrogen content of Xc = 0.5, dipole prograde g-modes in the period range 0.8-3 d are capable of differentiating between step and exponential diffusive overshooting. This ability disappears towards the terminal age main-sequence at Xc = 0.1. Furthermore, the g-modes behave the same for the three different shapes of radiative envelope mixing considered. However, a constant envelope mixing requires a diffusion coefficient near the convective core five times higher than chemical mixing from internal gravity waves to obtain a surface nitrogen excess of about 0.5 dex within the main-sequence lifetime. Within estimated frequency errors of the Kepler mission, the ability of g-modes to distinguish between step and exponential diffusive overshooting depends on the evolutionary stage. Combining information from the average period spacing and observed surface abundances, notably nitrogen, could potentially be used to constrain the shape of mixing in the radiative envelope of massive stars.

"We present observations made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and the Giant Metre-Wave Telescope of the radio source within the galaxy WISE~J071634.59-190039.2, claimed to be host of FRB~150418 by Keane et al. (2016). We have established a common flux density scale between the ATCA and JVLA observations, the main result of which is to increase the flux densities obtained by Keane et al. At a frequency of 5.5 GHz, the source has a mean flux density of 140uJy and is variable on short timescales with a modulation index of 0.36. Statistical analysis of the flux densities shows that the variations seen are consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation of the weak active galactic nucleus at the centre of the galaxy. It may therefore be the case that the FRB and the galaxy are not associated. However, taking into account the rarity of highly variable sources in the radio sky, and our lack of knowledge of the progenitors of FRBs as a class, the association between WISE~J071634.59-190039.2 and FRB~150418 remains a possibility. "
"We study the hadronization time of heavy quark in nuclear matter by using the coalescence model and the spatial diffusion constant of heavy quark from lattice Quantum Chromodynamic calculations, assuming that the main interaction of heavy quark at the critical temperature is hadronization. It is found that the hadronization time of heavy quark is about 3 fm/c for $2\pi T_c D_s=6$, if a heavy quark is combined with the nearest light antiquark in coordinate space without any correlation between momentum of heavy quark and that of light antiquark which form a heavy meson. However, the hadronization time reduces to 0.6-1.2 fm/c for charm and 0.4-0.9 fm/c for bottom, depending on heavy meson radius, in the presence of momentum correlation. Considering the interspace between quarks and antiquarks at the critical temperature, it seems that the hadronization of heavy quark does not happen instantaneously but gradually for a considerable time, if started from the thermal distribution of quarks and antiquarks. "
It is shown that the theory of aplanatic two-mirror telescopes developed by Karl Schwarzschild in 1905 leads to the unified description both the prefocal and the postfocal systems. The class of surfaces in the ZEMAX optical program has been properly extended to ascertain the image quality in exact Schwarzschild aplanats. A comparison of Schwarzschild aplanats with approximate Ritchey-Chretien and Gregory-Maksutov aplanatic telescopes reveals a noticeable advantage of the former at fast focal ratio of the system. 
"We establish well-posedness results for multidimensional non degenerate $\alpha$-stable driven SDEs with time inhomogeneous singular drifts in $\mathbb{L}^r-{\mathbb B}_{p,q}^{-1+\gamma}$ with $\gamma<1$ and $\alpha$ in $(1,2]$, where $\mathbb{L}^r$ and ${\mathbb B}_{p,q}^{-1+\gamma} $ stand for Lebesgue and Besov spaces respectively. Precisely, we first prove the well-posedness of the corresponding martingale problem and then give a precise meaning to the dynamics of the SDE. Our results rely on the smoothing properties of the underlying PDE, which is investigated by combining a perturbative approach with duality results between Besov spaces. "
"Non-linear sigma models that arise from the supersymmetric approach to disordered electron systems contain a non-compact bosonic sector. We study the model with target space H^2, the two-hyperboloid with isometry group SU(1,1), and prove that in three dimensions moments of the fields are finite in the thermodynamic limit. Thus the non-compact symmetry SU(1,1) is spontaneously broken. The bound on moments is compatible with the presence of extended states. "

"A search for direct production of C-even resonances a2(1320) and f2(1270) in e+e- annihilation was performed with SND detector at VEPP-2M e+e- collider. The upper limits of electronic widths of these mesons were obtained at 90% confidence level: Gamma(a2(1320) \to e+e-) < 0.56 eV, Gamma(f2(1270) \to e+e-) < 0.11 eV. "
"In the framework of the kt-factorization approach, we study the production of prompt photons associated with heavy (charm and beauty) quarks in hadron-hadron collisions at high energies. Our consideration is based on the amplitude for the production of a single photon associated with a quark pair in the fusion of two off-shell gluons. The total and differential cross sections are presented and the conservative error analysis is performed. Two sets of unintegrated gluon distributions in the proton have been used in numerical calculation: the one obtained from Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini evolution equation and the other from Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. The theoretical results are compared with recent experimental data taken by the CDF collaboration at the Fermilab Tevatron. Our analysis extends to specific angular correlations between the produced prompt photons and muons originating from semileptonic decays of the final charmed or beauty quarks. We point out the importance of such observables, which can serve as a crucial test for the unintegrated gluon densities in a proton. Finally, we extrapolate the theoretical predictions to the CERN LHC energies. This paper is dedicated to the memory of P.F. Ermolov, who died on May 14, 2008. "
"We present a scenario for the formation and evolution of disk galaxies within the framework of an inflationary CDM universe, and we compare the results with observations ranking from the present-day up to z~1. Galactic disks are built-up inside-out by gas infall with accretion rates driven by the cosmological mass aggregation history (MAH). We generate the MAHs for a Gaussian density fluctuation field, and we calculate the gravitational collapse and virialization of the dark halos. Assuming detailed angular momentum conservation, disks in centrifugal equilibrium are built-up within them. The disk galactic evolution is followed through a physically self-consistent approach. The main disk galaxy properties and their correlations are determined by the mass, the MAH, and the spin parameter. The models give exponential disk surface brightness (SB) profiles with realistic parameters (including LSB galaxies), nearly flat rotation curves, and negative gradients in the B-V radial profile. The main trends across the Hubble sequence are reproduced. A maximum in the star formation rate for most of the models is attained at z~ 1.5-2.5 (this rate is approximately 2.5-4.0 times larger than the present one). The scale radii and the bulge-to-total ratios decrease with z, while the central SB increase. The B-band TF relation remains almost the same at different redshifts. Our scenario reveals that the cosmological initial conditions are able to determine the main properties of disk galaxies and predict evolutionary features for the present-day dominant galaxy population that are in agreement with very recent deep field observational studies.

"Given two genomes with duplicate genes, \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} is the problem of deciding whether the two genomes can be reduced to the same genome without duplicate genes by deleting all but one copy of each gene in each genome. Blin, Fertin, Sikora, and Vialette recently proved that \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} for monochromosomal genomes is NP-hard even if each gene appears at most two times in each genome, thereby settling an important open question on genome rearrangement in the exemplar model. In this paper, we give a very simple alternative proof of this result. We also study the problem \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} for multichromosomal genomes without gene order, and prove the analogous result that it is also NP-hard even if each gene appears at most two times in each genome. For the positive direction, we show that both variants of \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} admit polynomial-time algorithms if each gene appears exactly once in one genome and at least once in the other genome. In addition, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the related problem \textsc{Exemplar Longest Common Subsequence} in the special case that each mandatory symbol appears exactly once in one input sequence and at least once in the other input sequence. This answers an open question of Bonizzoni et al. We also show that \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} for multichromosomal genomes without gene order is fixed-parameter tractable if the parameter is the maximum number of chromosomes in each genome. "
"We have computed the 15 microns integrated galaxy light produced by ISOCAM galaxies above a sensitivity limit of 50 microJy. It sets a lower limit to the 15 microns extragalactic background light of (2.4+/-0.5) nW/m^2/Hz. The redshift distribution of the ISOCAM galaxies is inferred from the spectroscopically complete sample of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN). We demonstrate that mid (MIR) and far (FIR) infrared luminosities correlate for local star forming galaxies and that this correlation is consistent with the radio-FIR one up to z ~ 1. From these correlations, about 75 % of the ISOCAM galaxies are found to belong to the class of luminous infrared galaxies (L[IR] >= 10^11 Lsol), with star formation rates of the order of ~ 100 Msol/yr. The cross-correlation with the deepest X-ray surveys from the Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories in the HDFN and Lockman Hole respectively, indicates that at most 20 % of the 15 microns integrated galaxy light is due to active galactic nuclei (AGNs) unless a large population of AGNs was missed by Chandra and XMM-Newton. The contribution of ISOCAM galaxies to the peak of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at 140 microns was computed from the MIR-FIR correlations for star forming galaxies and from the spectral energy distribution of the Seyfert 2, NGC 1068, for AGNs. We find that the galaxies unveiled by ISOCAM surveys are responsible for the bulk of the CIRB, i.e (16+/-5) nW/m^2/Hz as compared to the (25+/-7) nW/m^2/Hz measured with the COBE satellite, with less than 10 % due to AGNs. Since the CIRB contains most of the light radiated over the history of star formation in the universe, this means that a large fraction of present-day stars must have formed during a dusty starburst event similar to those revealed by ISOCAM.

"We investigate the dynamics of a coupled waveguide system with competing linear and nonlinear loss-gain profiles which can facilitate power saturation. We show the usefulness of the model in achieving unidirectional beam propagation. In this regard, the considered type of coupled waveguide system has two drawbacks, (i) difficulty in achieving perfect isolation of light in a waveguide and (ii) existence of blow-up type behavior for certain input power situations. We here show a nonlinear $\cal{PT}$ symmetric coupling that helps to overcome these two drawbacks. Such a nonlinear coupling has close connection with the phenomenon of stimulated Raman scattering. In particular, we have elucidated the role of this nonlinear coupling using an integrable $\cal{PT}$ symmetric situation. In particular, using the integrals of motion, we have reduced this coupled waveguide problem to the problem of dynamics of a particle in a potential. With the latter picture, we have clearly illustrated the role of the considered nonlinear coupling. The above $\cal{PT}$ symmetric case corresponds to a limiting form of a general equation describing the phenomenon of stimulated Raman scattering. We also point out the ability to transport light unidirectionally even in this general case. "
"Since the discovery of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions in many galaxies (LINERs), it has been recognized that they constitute a class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) which are thought to be powered by gas accretion onto a central, supermassive black hole. LINERs are observed in approximately one third of galaxies in the local universe and it has been often thought that they harbor an AGN-like central engine with moderate activity. However, some LINERs show no direct evidence for AGNs such as broad emission lines, radio jets, hard X-ray emission, spectral energy distributions which are inconsistent with starlight, and so on. For such LINERs (a subset of type 2 LINERs), we present new poststarburst models which explain some of their most important optical narrow emission-line ratios. In these models, the ionization sources are planetary nebula nuclei (PNNs) with temperature of ~ 10^5 K which appear in the late-phase evolution of intermediate-mass stars with mass between ~ 3 M_solar and ~ 6 M_solar. Such PNNs left in a typical starburst nucleus can produce an Halpha luminosity of L(Halpha) ~ 10^38 ergs s^-1 for typical poststarburst LINERs and ~ 10^39 ergs s^-1 only in exceptionally bright cases. The PNN phase lasts until the death of the lowest-mass stars formed in the starburst, which is ~ 5 x 10^8 yr for an assumed lower limit of the initial mass function of 3 M_solar. This long duration appears consistent with the observed higher frequency of occurrence of LINERs if every galaxy could experience the starburst activity several times in its life. We therefore propose that some LINERs which show no direct evidence for AGNs may be poststarburst nuclei powered by a cluster of PNNs. "
"Far ultraviolet (FUV) observations are excellent probes of the inner accretion disk, disk outflows, and the mass-accumulating white dwarf in cataclysmic variables. Here we study the contrasting behavior of two canonical dwarf novae in outburst by presenting FUSE FUV (904 -- 1187 A) spectroscopy of U Gem and SS Cyg. We observed each system four times during a single outburst. The outburst peak and early decline spectra of SS Cyg are well fit by models of a steady-state accretion disk and a biconical wind. A broad, blueshifted OVI wind-formed absorption line is the only strong spectral feature. In late outburst decline, OVI and CIII lines are seen as broad emission features and the continuum has flattened. In U Gem, the continua of the optical outburst plateau spectra are plausibly fit by accretion disk model spectra. The spectra also show numerous narrow, low-velocity absorption lines that do not originate in the inner accretion disk. We discuss the line spectra in the context of partial absorption of the FUV continuum by low-velocity, vertically-extended material located at large disk radii. The late outburst decline spectrum of U Gem is dominated by the white dwarf. WD model fits confirm the sub-solar C and super-solar N abundances found in earlier studies. "

"We study experimentally the impulse response of a cylinder wake below the critical Reynolds number of the B\'enard-von K\'arm\'an instability. In this subcritical regime, a localized inhomogeneous region of convective instability exists which causes initial perturbations to be transiently amplified. The aim of this work is to quantify the evolution resulting from this convective instability using two-dimensional particle image velocimetry in a hydrodynamic tunnel experiment. The velocity fields allow us to describe the evolution of wave packets in terms of two control parameters: the Reynolds number and the magnitude of the imposed perturbation. The temporal evolution of energy exhibits a transient algebraic growth at short times followed by an exponential decay. "
"The gravitational instability of Yang-Mills cosmologies is numerically studied with the hamiltonian formulation of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Yang-Mills equations with SU(2) gauge group. On the short term, the expansion dilutes the energy densities of the Yang-Mills fluctuations due to their conformal invariance. In this early regime, the gauge potentials appear oscillating quietly in an interaction potential quite similar to the one of the homogeneous case. However, on the long term, the expansion finally becomes significantly inhomogeneous and no more mimics a conformal transformation of the metric. Thereafter, the Yang-Mills fluctuations enter a complex non-linear regime, accompanied by diffusion, while their associated energy contrasts grow. "
"In three-dimensional topological insulators (3D TI) nanowires, transport occurs via gapless surface states where the spin is fixed perpendicular to the momentum[1-6]. Carriers encircling the surface thus acquire a \pi Berry phase, which is predicted to open up a gap in the lowest-energy 1D surface subband. Inserting a magnetic flux ({\Phi}) of h/2e through the nanowire should cancel the Berry phase and restore the gapless 1D mode[7-8]. However, this signature has been missing in transport experiments reported to date[9-11]. Here, we report measurements of mechanically-exfoliated 3D TI nanowires which exhibit Aharonov-Bohm oscillations consistent with topological surface transport. The use of low-doped, quasi-ballistic devices allows us to observe a minimum conductance at {\Phi} = 0 and a maximum conductance reaching e^2/h at {\Phi} = h/2e near the lowest subband (i.e. the Dirac point), as well as the carrier density dependence of the transport. "
"We explore the landscape of technical naturalness for nonrelativistic systems, finding surprises which challenge and enrich our relativistic intuition already in the simplest case of a single scalar field. While the immediate applications are expected in condensed matter and perhaps in cosmology, the study is motivated by the leading puzzles of fundamental physics involving gravity: The cosmological constant problem and the Higgs mass hierarchy problem.

"Existing models for extractive summarization are usually trained from scratch with a cross-entropy loss, which does not explicitly capture the global context at the document level. In this paper, we aim to improve this task by introducing three auxiliary pre-training tasks that learn to capture the document-level context in a self-supervised fashion. Experiments on the widely-used CNN/DM dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, we show that after pre-training, a clean model with simple building blocks is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art that are carefully designed. "
"We show that for any fixed $\eps>0$, there are numbers $\delta>0$ and $p_0\ge 2$ with the following property: for every prime $p\ge p_0$ and every integer $N$ such that $p^{1/(4\sqrt{e})+\eps}\le N\le p$, the sequence $1,2,...,N$ contains at least $\delta N$ quadratic non-residues modulo $p$. We use this result to obtain strong upper bounds on the sizes of the least quadratic non-residues in Beatty and Piatetski--Shapiro sequences. "
"We present analytical estimates and numerical calculations showing that the energy level density in open-shell atoms increases exponentially with increase of excitation energy.

The general framework and the present status of the low energy theory of the standard model are briefly reviewed. Recent applications to a few topic of interest for the determinations of Vud and of Vus are discussed 
"Although squaring integers is deterministic, squares modulo a prime, $p$, appear to be random. First, because they are all generated by the multiplicative linear congruential equation, $x_{i+1} = g^2 x_i \mod p$, where $x_0 = 1$ and $g$ is any primitive root of $p$, a pseudorandom number heuristic suggests that they are, in fact, unpredictable. Moreover, one type of cryptography makes use of discrete algorithms, which depends on the difficulty of solving $a = g^n$ for $n$ given $a$ and $g$. This suggests that the squares, which are exactly the even powers of $g$, are hard to identify. On the other hand, the Legendre symbol, $(a/p)$, which equals $1$ if a is a square modulo $p$ and $-1$ otherwise, has proven patterns. For example, $(ab/p) = (a/p)(b/p)$ holds true, and this shows that squares modulo $p$ have some structure. This paper considers the randomness of the following sequence: $(1/p), (2/p), ..., ((p-1)/p)$. Because it consists of binary data, the runs test is applied, which suggests that the number of runs is exactly (p-1)/2. This turns out to be a theorem proved by Aladov in 1896 that is not widely known. Consequently, this is an example of a number theory fact that is revealed naturally in a statistical setting, but one that has rarely been noted by mathematicians. "
"In this short article we introduce the mathematical framework of the principle of the fermionic projector and set up a variational principle in discrete space-time. The underlying physical principles are discussed. We outline the connection to the continuum theory and state recent results.

We study the finite temperature phase transition of four and two flavor staggered fermions with hypercubic smeared link actions. These preliminary studies suggest that the improved flavor symmetry of the fermionic action can have a significant effect on the finite temperature phase diagram. 
"ABC-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG) are predicted to exhibit novel many-body phenomena due to the existence of almost dispersionless flat-band structures near the charge neutrality point (CNP). Here, using high magnetic field scanning tunneling microscopy, we present Landau Level (LL) spectroscopy measurements of high-quality ABC-stacked TLG. We observe an approximately linear magnetic-field-scaling of the valley splitting and orbital splitting in the ABC-stacked TLG. Our experiment indicates that the valley splitting decreases dramatically with increasing the LL index. When the lowest LL is partially filled, we find an obvious enhancement of the orbital splitting, attributing to strong many-body effects. Moreover, we observe linear energy scaling of the inverse lifetime of quasiparticles, providing an additional evidence for the strong electron-electron interactions in the ABC-stacked TLG. These results imply that interesting broken-symmetry states and novel electron correlation effects could emerge in the ABC-stacked TLG in the presence of high magnetic fields. "
"We have developed a variational perturbation theory based on the Liouville-Neumann equation, which enables one to systematically compute the perturbative correction terms to the variationally determined wave functions of the time-dependent systems. We then apply the method to the time-independent anharmonic oscillator, and show that the results agree with those of other variational perturbation theories. We also show that the system has an interesting algebraic structure at the first order correction level. "
"The oracle identification problem (OIP) was introduced by Ambainis et al. \cite{AIKMRY04}. It is given as a set $S$ of $M$ oracles and a blackbox oracle $f$. Our task is to figure out which oracle in $S$ is equal to the blackbox $f$ by making queries to $f$. OIP includes several problems such as the Grover Search as special cases. In this paper, we improve the algorithms in \cite{AIKMRY04} by providing a mostly optimal upper bound of query complexity for this problem: ($i$) For any oracle set $S$ such that $|S| \le 2^{N^d}$ ($d < 1$), we design an algorithm whose query complexity is $O(\sqrt{N\log{M}/\log{N}})$, matching the lower bound proved in \cite{AIKMRY04}. ($ii$) Our algorithm also works for the range between $2^{N^d}$ and $2^{N/\log{N}}$ (where the bound becomes O(N)), but the gap between the upper and lower bounds worsens gradually. ($iii$) Our algorithm is robust, namely, it exhibits the same performance (up to a constant factor) against the noisy oracles as also shown in the literatures \cite{AC02,BNRW03,HMW03} for special cases of OIP.

"Recent results in study of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model as the effective low energy theory give important hints for experimental search for supersymmetry. Also, in the bottom-up approach to explore weak scale - GUT scale connection, they constrain strongly physics at the GUT scale. Several theoretical ideas about the GUT physics are in stunning agreement with the low energy data. "
"We consider the orthogonal polynomials, $\{P_n(z)\}_{n=0,1,\cdots}$, with respect to the measure $$|z-a|^{2c} e^{-N|z|^2}dA(z)$$ supported over the whole complex plane, where $a>0$, $N>0$ and $c>-1$. We look at the scaling limit where $n$ and $N$ tend to infinity while keeping their ratio, $n/N$, fixed. The support of the limiting zero distribution is given in terms of certain ""limiting potential-theoretic skeleton"" of the unit disk. We show that, as we vary $c$, both the skeleton and the asymptotic distribution of the zeros behave discontinuously at $c=0$. The smooth interpolation of the discontinuity is obtained by the further scaling of $c=e^{-\eta N}$ in terms of the parameter $\eta\in[0,\infty).$ "
"The phenomenon of Coulombic friction enters the stochastic description of dry friction between two solids and the statistic characterization of vibrating granular media. Here we analyze the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation including both velocity and spatial components, exhibiting a formal connection to a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator in the presence of a delta potential. Numerical solutions for the resulting spatial displacement statistics show a crossover from exponential to Gaussian displacement statistics. We identify a transient intermediate regime that exhibits multiscaling properties arising from the contribution of Coulombic friction. The possible role of these effects during observations in diffusion experiments is shortly discussed. "
"The waves of fermions display nonlocality in low energy limit of quantum fields. In this \QTR{it}{ab initio} paper we propose a complex-geometry model that reveals the affection of nonlocality on the interaction between material particles of spin-1/2. To make nonlocal properties appropriately involved in a quantum theory, the special unitary group SU(n) and spinor representation $D^{(1/2,1/2)}$ of Lorentz group are generalized by making complex spaces--which are spanned by wave functions of quantum particles--curved. The curved spaces are described by the geometry used in General Relativity by replacing the real space with complex space and additionally imposing the analytic condition on the space. The field equations for fermions and for bosons are respectively associated with geodesic motion equations and with local curvature of the considered space. The equation for fermions can restore all the terms of quadratic form of Dirac equation. According to the field equation it is found that, for the U(1) field [generalized Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)], when the electromagnetic fields $\vec E$ and $\vec B$ satisfy $\vec E^2-\vec B^2\neq 0$, the bosons will gain masses. In this model, a physical region is empirically defined, which can be characterized by a determinant occurring in boson field equation. Applying the field equation to U(3) field [generalized Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)], the quark-confining property can be understood by carrying out the boundary of physical region. "
"For some theories where the degrees of freedom are tensors of rank $3$ or higher, there exist solvable large $N$ limits dominated by the melonic diagrams. Simple examples are provided by models containing one rank-$3$ tensor in the tri-fundamental representation of the $O(N)^3$ symmetry group. When the quartic interaction is assumed to have a special tetrahedral index structure, the coupling constant $g$ must be scaled as $N^{-3/2}$ in the melonic large $N$ limit. In this paper we consider the combinatorics of a large $N$ theory of one fully symmetric and traceless rank-$3$ tensor with the tetrahedral quartic interaction; this model has a single $O(N)$ symmetry group. We explicitly calculate all the vacuum diagrams up to order $g^8$, as well as some diagrams of higher order, and find that in the large $N$ limit where $g^2 N^3$ is held fixed only the melonic diagrams survive. While some non-melonic diagrams are enhanced in the $O(N)$ symmetric theory compared to the $O(N)^3$ one, we have not found any diagrams where this enhancement is strong enough to make them comparable with the melonic ones. Motivated by these results, we conjecture that the model of a real rank-$3$ symmetric traceless tensor possesses a smooth large $N$ limit where $g^2 N^3$ is held fixed and all the contributing diagrams are melonic. A feature of the symmetric traceless tensor models is that some vacuum diagrams containing odd numbers of vertices are suppressed only by $N^{-1/2}$ relative to the melonic graphs. "
"In this paper, we will propose that magnetic-resonance nanostructures in a metal surface could be used to realize extraordinary optical transmission (EOT). Toward this goal, we designed and fabricated a one dimensional diatomic chain of slit-hole resonator (SHR). Due to the strong exchange current interaction, a type of magnetic plasmon (MP) propagation mode with a broad frequency bandwidth was established in this system. Apparent EOT peaks induced by the MP mode were observed in our measured spectra at infrared frequencies. The strongest EOT peak was obtained at 1.07 eV with an incident angle of 20 degree. The measured dependence of EOT peaks on the incident angle coincided with the theoretical results quite well. This proposed MP propagation mode in SHR structure has good potential applications in multifrequency nonlinear optical processes. "
"We report measurement of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) hadron trigger, for p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, in p-Pb events classified by event activity. This observable has been measured in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, providing a new probe to measure quenching. Jets are reconstructed from charged particle tracks using anti-$k_{\rm t}$ with $R = 0.4$ and low IR cutoff of jet constituents ($p_{\rm T,track} > 0.15$ GeV/$c$). The complex uncorrelated jet background is corrected by a data-driven approach. Recoil jet distributions are reported for $15 < p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch} < 50$ GeV/$c$. Events are classified by signal in the ALICE V0A detector, which measures forward multiplicity, and ZNA, which measures the number of neutrons at zero degrees. This self-normalized observable does not require scaling of reference distributions by $T_{\rm pA}$ , thereby avoiding the need for geometric modeling. We compare the trigger-normalized recoil jet yield for p-Pb collisions with different event activity to measure the effects of jet quenching in small systems at the LHC. "
"For a connected graph, the distance spectral radius is the largest eigenvalue of its distance matrix. In this paper, of all trees with both given order and fixed diameter, the trees with the minimal distance spectral radius are completely characterized. "
"We develop a stochastic approach to time-dependent DFT with optimally-tuned range-separated hybrids containing non-local exchange, for calculating optical spectra. The attractive electron-hole interaction, which leads to the formation of excitons, is included through a time-dependent linear-response technique with a non-local exchange interaction which is computed very efficiently through a stochastic scheme. The method is inexpensive and scales quadratically with the number of electrons, at almost the same (low) cost of time dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) with local functionals. Our results are in excellent agreement with experimental data and the efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on large finite phosphorene sheets containing up to 1958 valence electrons. "
"The cosmological Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identity of the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a single inflaton field is obtained from the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) symmetry associated with diffeomorphism invariance in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism. The consistency conditions between the correlators of the scalar and tensor modes in the squeezed limit are then derived from the ST identity, together with the softly broken conformal symmetry. Maldacena's original relations connecting the 2- and 3-point correlators at horizon crossing are recovered, as well as the next-to-leading corrections, controlled by the special conformal transformations. "
"Consider the unnormalized Ricci flow $(g_{ij})_t = -2R_{ij}$ for $t\in [0,T)$, where $T < \infty$. Richard Hamilton showed that if the curvature operator is uniformly bounded under the flow for all times $t\in [0,T)$ then the solution can be extended beyond $T$. We prove that if the Ricci curvature is uniformly bounded under the flow for all times $t\in [0,T)$, then the curvature tensor has to be uniformly bounded as well. "
"For lensing galaxies we introduce a formal velocity dispersion sigma_lens, based on enclosed mass and the virial theorem. This is calculated from an ensemble of pixelated lens models, and found to be fairly model independent. A sample of 18 well-known early-type lensing galaxies and two clusters is found to be consistent with the equality of sigma_lens and the kinematic velocity dispersion sigma_obs. Both the early-type lensing galaxies and the clusters can thus be determined as being virialized. In a second step we calculate the I-band luminosity and the total mass content for the sample of lensing galaxies, which enables us to analyze the mass-to-light relation L ~ M^a. We determine a = 0.70 +/- 0.08, excluding constant M/L and consistent with previous studies of the Fundamental Plane. Additionally we verify that this relation does not extrapolate to clusters, which have a much higher M/L. The sample used for this analysis comprises 9 lensing galaxies from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS) and another 9 from the CfA-Arizona Space Telescope LEns Survey (CASTLES) as well as the lensing clusters ACO 1689 and ACO 2667. "
"Classical scale invariance (CSI) may be one of the solutions for the hierarchy problem. Realistic models for electroweak symmetry breaking based on CSI require extended scalar sectors without mass terms, and the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically at the quantum level by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We discuss discriminative features of these models. First, using the experimental value of the mass of the discovered Higgs boson $h(125)$, we obtain an upper bound on the mass of the lightest additional scalar boson (~543 GeV), which does not depend on its isospin and hypercharge. Second, a discriminative prediction on the Higgs-photon-photon coupling is given as a function of the number of charged scalar bosons, by which we can narrow down possible models using current and future data for the di-photon decay of $h(125)$. Finally, for the triple Higgs boson coupling a large deviation (~ +70 %) from the SM prediction is universally predicted, which is independent of masses, quantum numbers and even the number of additional scalars. These models based on CSI can be well tested at LHC Run II and at future lepton colliders. "
"A basic result is that the sample variance for i.i.d. observations is an unbiased estimator of the variance of the underlying distribution (see for instance Casella and Berger (2002)). But what happens if the observations are neither independent nor identically distributed. What can we say? Can we in particular compute explicitly the first two moments of the sample mean and hence generalize formulae provided in Tukey (1957a), Tukey (1957b) for the first two moments of the sample variance? We also know that the sample mean and variance are independent if they are computed on an i.i.d. normal distribution. This is one of the underlying assumption to derive the Student distribution Student alias W. S. Gosset (1908). But does this result hold for any other underlying distribution? Can we still have independent sample mean and variance if the distribution is not normal? This paper precisely answers these questions and extends previous work of Cho, Cho, and Eltinge (2004). We are able to derive a general formula for the first two moments and variance of the sample variance under no specific assumption. We also provide a faster proof of a seminal result of Lukacs (1942) by using the log characteristic function of the unbiased sample variance estimator. "
"5G systems aim to achieve extremely high data rates, low end-to-end latency and ultra-low power consumption. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the design of 5G physical layer waveforms. One important candidate is Generalised Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM). In order to evaluate its performance and features, system-level studies should be undertaken in a range of scenarios. These studies, however, require highly complex computations if they are performed using bit-level simulators. In this paper, the Mutual Information (MI) based link quality model (PHY abstraction), which has been regularly used to implement system-level studies for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), is applied to GFDM. The performance of the GFDM waveform using this model and the bit-level simulation performance is measured using different channel types. Moreover, a system-level study for a GFDM based LTE-A system in a realistic scenario, using both a bit-level simulator and this abstraction model, has been studied and compared. The results reveal the accuracy of this model using realistic channel data. Based on these results, the PHY abstraction technique can be applied to evaluate the performance of GFDM based systems in an effective manner with low complexity. The maximum difference in the Packet Error Rate (PER) and throughput results in the abstraction case compared to bit-level simulation does not exceed 4% whilst offering a simulation time saving reduction of around 62,000 times. "
In this paper we point out that Starobinky inflation could be induced by quantum effects due to a large non-minimal coupling of the Higgs boson to the Ricci scalar. The Higgs Starobinsky mechanism provides a solution to issues attached to large Higgs field values in the early universe which in a metastable universe would not be a viable option. We verify explicitly that these large quantum corrections do not destabilize Starobinsky's potential. 
"The excessive compensation packages of CEOs of U.S. corporations in recent years have brought to the foreground the issue of fairness in economics. The conventional wisdom is that the free market for labor, which determines the pay packages, cares only about efficiency and not fairness. We present an alternative theory that shows that an ideal free market environment also promotes fairness, as an emergent property resulting from the self-organizing market dynamics. Even though an individual employee may care only about his or her salary and no one else's, the collective actions of all the employees, combined with the profit maximizing actions of all the companies, in a free market environment under budgetary constraints, lead towards a more fair allocation of wages, guided by Adam Smith's invisible hand of self-organization. By exploring deep connections with statistical thermodynamics, we show that entropy is the appropriate measure of fairness in a free market environment which is maximized at equilibrium to yield the lognormal distribution of salaries as the fairest inequality of pay in an organization under ideal conditions. "
"We study the multifield inflationary models where the cosmological perturbation is sourced by light scalar fields other than the inflaton. We exploit the operator product expansion and partly the symmetries present during the de Sitter epoch to characterize the non-Gaussian four-point correlator in the squeezed limit. We point out that the contribution to it from the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the light fields at horizon crossing can be larger than the usually studied contribution arising on superhorizon scales and it comes with a different shape. Our findings indicate that particular attention needs to be taken when studying the effects of the primordial NG on real observables, such as the clustering of dark matter halos. "
"We use simulated merger trees of galaxy-cluster halos to study the effect of the halo concentration distribution on strong lensing and X-ray emission. Its log-normal shape typically found in simulations favors outliers with high concentration. Since, at fixed mass, more concentrated halos tend to be more efficient lenses, the scatter in the concentration increases the strong-lensing optical depth by $\lesssim50%$. Within cluster samples, mass and concentration have counteracting effects on strong lensing and X-ray emission because the concentration decreases for increasing mass. Selecting clusters by concentration thus has no effect on the lensing cross section. The most efficiently lensing and hottest clusters are typically the \textit{least} concentrated in samples with a broad mass range. Among cluster samples with a narrow mass range, however, the most strongly lensing and X-ray brightest clusters are typically 10% to 25% more concentrated. "
"Strong interaction between two single photons is a long standing and important goal in quantum photonics. This would enable a new regime of nonlinear optics and unlock several applications in quantum information science, including photonic quantum gates and deterministic Bell-state measurements. In the context of quantum networks, it would be important to achieve interactions between single photons from independent photon pairs storable in quantum memories. So far, most experiments showing nonlinearities at the single-photon level have used weak classical input light. Here, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of a paired single photon emitted by an ensemble quantum memory in a strongly nonlinear medium based on highly excited Rydberg atoms. We show that nonclassical correlations between the two photons persist after retrieval from the Rydberg ensemble. Our result is an important step towards deterministic photon-photon interactions, and may enable deterministic Bell-state measurements with multimode quantum memories. "
We show that the anomalous diffusion equations with a fractional derivative in the Caputo or Riesz sense are strictly related to the special convolution properties of the L\'evy stable distributions which stem from the evolution properties of stretched or compressed exponential function. The formal solutions of these fractional differential equations are found by using the evolution operator method where the evolution operator is presented as integral transforms whose kernel is the Green function. Exact and explicit examples of the solutions are reported and studied for various fractional order of derivatives and different initial conditions. 
"We develop the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) formalism for the superconductivity of carbon nanotubes. It is found that the superconducting transition temperature Tc of single-wall carbon nanotubes decreases exponentially with the increase of the tube diameter because the density of states near the Fermi energy is inversely proportional to the tube diameter. For the multi-wall carbon nanotubes, the Cooper paring hopping between layers enhances the superconducting correlation and increases the superconducting transition temperature, which is consistent with the experimental observation. "
"Using the Cantero-Grunbaum-Moral-Velazquez (CGMV) method, we obtain the spectral measure for the quantum walk. "
"[Taken from the ""README"" in the book] My goal with this book is to provide some kind of bridge for mathematics between the high-school-level and college-level for physics students. From my perspective, our job as physicists is to observe and understand the universe around us. Unfortunately our universe happens to be pretty complicated, at least from a mathematical point-of-view. However, a lot of the underlying physics | the underlying set of rules surrounding how things move and behave | is usually not too complicated. Sure, when we couple things together, everything turns disgusting, and we need to turn to really powerful computers or simulators to get a lot accomplished. But the basic rules are not that bad. My hope is to provide enough of a conceptual framework for you to learn to $read$ math as I saw a lot of other physicists do when I started my undergraduate career. I plan to cover some of the topics that tend to trip up a lot of physics students, although I could not cover these exhaustively. When I found that I should have covered more, but could not due to finite time constraints, I left a reference to other work that I think you may find helpful. However, unlike a lot of works, my focus is to help modify your thinking of how math is used, rather than just pummel you with algorithms for you to memorize without giving you the proper context for such algorithms. Whenever you find my explanations long-winded, feel free to proceed through faster. If you get stuck, you are always free to go back and see what I might have referenced before. "
"The generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) is a family of tractable models that alleviates the limitations of the Poisson family in dynamic Bayesian inference of point processes. In this paper, we derive closed form expressions for the void probability functional and the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence for GLMBs. The proposed analytic void probability functional is a necessary and sufficient statistic that uniquely characterizes a GLMB, while the proposed analytic Cauchy-Schwarz divergence provides a tractable measure of similarity between GLMBs. We demonstrate the use of both results on a partially observed Markov decision process for GLMBs, with Cauchy-Schwarz divergence based reward, and void probability constraint. "
"Hybrid systems of excitons strongly coupled to localized surface plasmons supported by metallic nanoparticles define a new approach to control light-matter interactions. Here, we report exciton-plasmon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WS2, hybridized with silver nanoparticles. Prominent photoluminescence enhancement in monolayer MoS2 was observed with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) tuned to the exciton resonance. By tuning the excitation energy, the contributions from near field enhancement and radiative emission rate enhancement via Purcell effect were resolved. Strong coherent dipole-dipole coupling between excitons and LSPR in resonant condition manifests as an electromagnetically induced transparency window in the extinction spectra of the localized surface plasmon. In this strong coupling regime a new quasi-particle, known as a plexciton, is expected to exhibit distinct properties, which exist in neither of the original particles. Our results demonstrate that 2D semiconductors hybridized with plasmonic structures not only hold great promise in the applications of energy-harvesting and light-emitting devices, but also provide an attractive platform for fundamental investigations of exciton-plasmon interactions in the strong coupling regime. "
"Systematic investigations of the structural and magnetic properties of single crystal (Ga,Mn)N films grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy are presented. High resolution transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, and extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies do not reveal any crystallographic phase separation and indicate that Mn occupies Ga-substitutional sites in the Mn concentration range up to 1%. The magnetic properties as a function of temperature, magnetic field and its orientation with respect to the c-axis of the wurtzite structure can be quantitatively described by the paramagnetic theory of an ensemble of non-interacting Mn$^{3+}$ ions in the relevant crystal field, a conclusion consistent with the x-ray absorption near edge structure analysis. A negligible contribution of Mn in the 2+ charge state points to a low concentration of residual donors in the studied films. Studies on modulation doped p-type (Ga,Mn)N/(Ga,Al)N:Mg heterostructures do not reproduce the high temperature robust ferromagnetism reported recently for this system. "
"Semi-supervised learning is an important and active topic of research in pattern recognition. For classification using linear discriminant analysis specifically, several semi-supervised variants have been proposed. Using any one of these methods is not guaranteed to outperform the supervised classifier which does not take the additional unlabeled data into account. In this work we compare traditional Expectation Maximization type approaches for semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis with approaches based on intrinsic constraints and propose a new principled approach for semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis, using so-called implicit constraints. We explore the relationships between these methods and consider the question if and in what sense we can expect improvement in performance over the supervised procedure. The constraint based approaches are more robust to misspecification of the model, and may outperform alternatives that make more assumptions on the data, in terms of the log-likelihood of unseen objects. "
"The densest binary sphere packings in the alpha-x plane of small to large sphere radius ratio alpha and small sphere relative concentration x have historically been very difficult to determine. Previous research had led to the prediction that these packings were composed of a few known ""alloy"" phases including, for example, the AlB2 (hexagonal omega), HgBr2, and AuTe2 structures, and to XYn structures composed of close-packed large spheres with small spheres (in a number ratio of n to 1) in the interstices, e.g., the NaCl packing for n = 1. However, utilizing an implementation of the Torquato-Jiao sphere-packing algorithm [S. Torquato and Y. Jiao, Phys. Rev. E 82, 061302 (2010)], we have discovered that many more structures appear in the densest packings. For example, while all previously known densest structures were composed of spheres in small to large number ratios of one to one, two to one, and very recently three to one, we have identified densest structures with number ratios of seven to three and five to two. In a recent work [A. B. Hopkins, Y. Jiao, F. H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 125501 (2011)], we summarized these findings. In this work, we present the structures of the densest-known packings and provide details about their characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that a broad array of different densest mechanically stable structures consisting of only two types of components can form without any consideration of attractive or anisotropic interactions. In addition, the novel structures that we have identified may correspond to currently unidentified stable phases of certain binary atomic and molecular systems, particularly at high temperatures and pressures.

"Cavitation is a limiting phenomenon in many domains of fluid mechanics. Instabilities of a partial cavity developed on an hydrofoil, a converging-diverging step or in an inter-blade channel in turbomachinery, have already been investigated and described in many previous works. The aim of this study is to evaluate a passive control method of the sheet cavity. According to operating conditions, cavitation can be described by two different regimes: an unstable regime with a cloud cavitation shedding and a stable regime with only a pulsating sheet cavity. Avoiding cloud cavitation can limit structure damages since a pulsating sheet cavity is less agressive. The surface condition of a converging-diverging step, like a Venturi-type obstacle, is here studied as a solution for a passive control of the cavitation. This study discusses the effect of an organized roughness, in the shape of longitudinal grooves, on the developed sheet cavity. Analyzes conducted with Laser Doppler Velocimetry, visualisations and pressure measurements show that the grooves geometry, and especially the groove depth, acts on the sheet cavity dynamics. Results show that modifying the surface condition, by varying the grooves geometry, can reduce cavity sheet length and even suppress the cloud cavitation shedding. "
"We establish a Pontryagin maximum principle for discrete time optimal control problems under the following three types of constraints: a) constraints on the states pointwise in time, b) constraints on the control actions pointwise in time, and c) constraints on the frequency spectrum of the optimal control trajectories. While the first two types of constraints are already included in the existing versions of the Pontryagin maximum principle, it turns out that the third type of constraints cannot be recast in any of the standard forms of the existing results for the original control system. We provide two different proofs of our Pontryagin maximum principle in this article, and include several special cases fine-tuned to control-affine nonlinear and linear system models. In particular, for minimization of quadratic cost functions and linear time invariant control systems, we provide tight conditions under which the optimal controls under frequency constraints are either normal or abnormal.

"Using strong-disorder renormalization group, numerical exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo methods, we revisit the random antiferromagnetic XXZ spin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of the average time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilon l^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent) power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3, otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e = -1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered. Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal. The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties, interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors. "
"TMAC is a toolbox written in C++11 that implements algorithms based on a set of modern methods for large-scale optimization. It covers a variety of optimization problems, which can be both smooth and nonsmooth, convex and nonconvex, as well as constrained and unconstrained. The algorithms implemented in TMAC, such as the coordinate up- date method and operator splitting method, are scalable as they decompose a problem into simple subproblems. These algorithms can run in a multi-threaded fashion, either synchronously or asynchronously, to take advantages of all the cores available. TMAC architecture mimics how a scientist writes down an optimization algorithm. Therefore, it is easy for one to obtain a new algorithm by making simple modifications such as adding a new operator and adding a new splitting, while maintaining the multicore parallelism and other features. The package is available at https://github.com/uclaopt/TMAC. "
"If a homogeneous plane light-like shell collides head-on with a homogeneous plane electromagnetic shock wave having a step-function profile then no backscattered gravitational waves are produced. We demonstrate, by explicit calculation, that if the matter is accompanied by a homogeneous plane electromagnetic shock wave with a step-function profile then backscattered gravitational waves appear after the collision. "
"We perform a multi-parameter global analysis of all data available till date from the ATLAS, CMS and Tevatron experiments, on the signals of a Higgs boson, to investigate how much scope exists for departure from the standard model prediction. We adopt a very general and model-independent scenario, where separate deviations from standard model values are possible for couplings of the observed scalar with up-and down-type fermions, W-and Z-boson pairs, as well as gluon and photon pair effective interactions. An arbitrary phase in the coupling with the top-pair, and the provision for an invisible decay width for the scalar are also introduced. After performing a global fit with seven parameters, we find that their values at 95% confidence level can be considerably different from standard model expectations. Moreover, rather striking implications of the phase in top-quark coupling are noticed. We also note that the invisible branching ratio can be sizeable, especially when the couplings of the Higgs to W-and Z-pairs are allowed to be different. "
"Lord Kelvin with his discovery of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) phenomenon in Ni and Fe was 70 years ahead of the formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics the effect stems from, and almost one and a half century ahead of spintronics whose first commercial applications relied on the AMR. Despite the long history and importance in magnetic sensing and memory technologies, the microscopic understanding of the AMR has struggled to go far beyond the basic notion of a relativistic magnetotransport phenomenon arising from combined effects on diffusing carriers of spin-orbit coupling and broken symmetry of a metallic ferromagnet. Our work demonstrates that even this seemingly generic notion of the AMR phenomenon needs revisiting as we observe the ohmic AMR effect in a nano-scale film of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor Sr2IrO4 (SIO). Our work opens the recently proposed path for integrating semiconducting and spintronic technologies in AFMs. SIO is a particularly favorable material for exploring this path since its semiconducting nature is entangled with the AFM order and strong spin-orbit coupling. For the observation of the low-field Ohmic AMR in SIO we prepared an epitaxial heterostructure comprising a nano-scale SIO film on top of an epilayer of a FM metal La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO). This allows the magnetic field control of the orientation of AFM spins in SIO via the exchange spring effect at the FM-AFM interface. "
"Machine Translation is the translation of one natural language into another using automated and computerized means. For a multilingual country like India, with the huge amount of information exchanged between various regions and in different languages in digitized format, it has become necessary to find an automated process from one language to another. In this paper, we take a look at the various Machine Translation System in India which is specifically built for the purpose of translation between the Indian languages. We discuss the various approaches taken for building the machine translation system and then discuss some of the Machine Translation Systems in India along with their features. "
We investigate the possible total radiated energy produced by a binary black hole system containing non-vanishing total angular momentum. For the scenearios considered we find that the total radiated energy does not exceed 1%. Additionally we explore the gravitational radiation field and the variation of angular momentum in the process. 
"The ALMA SPECtroscopic Survey in the {\it Hubble} Ultra Deep Field is an ALMA large program that obtained a frequency scan in the 3\,mm band to detect emission lines from the molecular gas in distant galaxies. We here present our search strategy for emission lines and continuum sources in the HUDF. We compare several line search algorithms used in the literature, and critically account for the line-widths of the emission line candidates when assessing significance. We identify sixteen emission lines at high fidelity in our search. Comparing these sources to multi-wavelength data we find that all sources have optical/infrared counterparts. Our search also recovers candidates that have lower significance that can be used statistically to derive, e.g. the CO luminosity function. We apply the same detection algorithm to obtain a sample of six 3 mm continuum sources. All of these are also detected in the 1.2 mm continuum with optical/near-infrared counterparts. We use the continuum sources to compute 3 mm number counts in the sub-mJy regime, and find them to be higher by an order of magnitude than expected for synchrotron-dominated sources. However, the number counts are consistent with those derived at shorter wavelengths (0.85--1.3\,mm) once extrapolating to 3\,mm with a dust emissivity index of $\beta=1.5$, dust temperature of 35\,K and an average redshift of $z=2.5$. These results represent the best constraints to date on the faint end of the 3 mm number counts. "
"Our purpose in this paper is to apply some maximum principles in order to study the rigidity of complete spacelike hypersurfaces immersed in a spatially weighted generalized Robertson-Walker (GRW) spacetime, which is supposed to obey the so called strong null convergence condition. Under natural constraints on the weight function and on the f-mean curvature, we establish sufficient conditions to guarantee that such a hypersurface must be a slice of the ambient space. In this setting, we also obtain new Calabi-Bernstein type results concerning entire graphs in a spatially weighted GRW spacetime. "
"We model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halos over the range $0.1<z<1.3$, using the data from the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for a set of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained using two variants of Halo Occupation Distribution models. These provide us with a set of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a halo and average number of galaxies per halo. We find that after accounting for the evolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the same population, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass with decreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario. Using two different HOD models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over the redshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. This is the first time the evolution in halo mass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and it follows the simple form seen in N-body simulations with $M(z) = M_0 e^{-\beta z}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. This provides evidence for a rapid accretion phase of massive halos having a present-day mass $M_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1} M_\odot$, with a $m > 0.1 M_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5 and 1.0. Futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupy more massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. Finally, the average number of galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$ 0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1, likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos. "
"We report on precise measurements of absolute nonlinear ionization probabilities obtained by exposing optically trapped ultracold rubidium atoms to the field of an ultrashort laser pulse in the intensity range of $1 \times 10^{11}$ to $4 \times 10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$. The experimental data are in perfect agreement with ab-initio theory, based on solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation without any free parameters. Ultracold targets allow to retrieve absolute probabilities since ionized atoms become apparent as a local vacancy imprinted into the target density, which is recorded simultaneously. We study the strong-field response of $^{87}$Rb atoms at two different wavelengths representing non-resonant and resonant processes in the demanding regime where the Keldysh parameter is close to unity. "
"We present a unified analysis of the decays of bottomonia Upsilon(mS) -> Upsilon(nS) pi pi (m>n, m=2,3,4,5, n=1,2,3), charmonia J/psi -> phi (pi pi, K antiK), psi(2S) -> J/psi pi pi and the isoscalar S-wave processes pi pi -> pi pi, K antiK, eta eta. In this analysis we extend our recent study of low-lying (m=2,3) radial excitations of bottomonia to modes involving higher (m=4,5) excited states. Similarly as for the data on lower radial excitations, we confirm that the data for higher radially excited states from the BaBar and Belle collaborations can be described under conditions that the final bottomonium is a spectator and the multichannel pi pi scattering is considered in a model-independent approach based on analyticity, unitarity and the uniformization procedure. Indeed we show that the dipion mass distributions in the two-pion transitions of both charmonia and bottomonia states are explained by a unified mechanism based on the contribution of the pi pi and K antiK coupled channels including their interference (final-state interactions). Therefore, our main result is that the lower and higher radially excited states of charmonia and bottomonia have no specific features in mutual comparison and can be understood in a unified picture, e.g. proposed by our approach.

"The capacity region of multi-pair bidirectional relay networks, in which a relay node facilitates the communication between multiple pairs of users, is studied. This problem is first examined in the context of the linear shift deterministic channel model. The capacity region of this network when the relay is operating at either full-duplex mode or half-duplex mode for arbitrary number of pairs is characterized. It is shown that the cut-set upper-bound is tight and the capacity region is achieved by a so called divide-and-conquer relaying strategy. The insights gained from the deterministic network are then used for the Gaussian bidirectional relay network. The strategy in the deterministic channel translates to a specific superposition of lattice codes and random Gaussian codes at the source nodes and successive interference cancelation at the receiving nodes for the Gaussian network. The achievable rate of this scheme with two pairs is analyzed and it is shown that for all channel gains it achieves to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user of the cut-set upper-bound. Hence, the capacity region of the two-pair bidirectional Gaussian relay network to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user is characterized. "
"One growing use of computer-based communication media is for gathering people to initiate or sustain social events. Although the use of computer-mediated communication and social network sites such as Facebook for event promotion is becoming popular, online participation in an event does not always translate to offline attendance. In this paper, we report on an interview study of 31 participants that examines how people handle online event invitations and what influences their online and offline participation. The results show that people's event participation is shaped by their social perceptions of the event's nature (e.g., public or private), their relationships to others (e.g., the strength of their connections to other invitees), and the medium used to communicate event information (e.g., targeted invitation via email or spam communication via Facebook event page). By exploring how people decide whether to participate online or offline, the results illuminate the sophisticated nature of the mechanisms that affect participation and have design implications that can bridge virtual and real attendance. "
"We present a dispersion relation in the pion-mass squared, which static quantities (nucleon mass, magnetic moment, etc.) obey under the assumption of analyticity in the entire complex $m_\pi^2$ plane modulo a cut at negative $m_\pi^2$ associated with pion production. The relation is verified here in a number of examples of nucleon and $\Delta$-isobar properties computed in chiral perturbation theory up to order $p^3$. We outline a method to obtain relations for other mass-dependencies, and illustrate it on a two-loop example. "
"Rapid miniaturization and cost reduction of computing, along with the availability of wearable and implantable physiological sensors have led to the growth of human Body Area Network (BAN) formed by a network of such sensors and computing devices. One promising application of such a network is wearable health monitoring where the collected data from the sensors would be transmitted and analyzed to assess the health of a person. Typically, the devices in a BAN are connected through wireless (WBAN), which suffers from energy inefficiency due to the high-energy consumption of wireless transmission. Human Body Communication (HBC) uses the relatively low loss human body as the communication medium to connect these devices, promising order(s) of magnitude better energy-efficiency and built-in security compared to WBAN. In this paper, we demonstrate a health monitoring device and system built using Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) sensors and components, that can collect data from physiological sensors and transmit it through a) intra-body HBC to another device (hub) worn on the body or b) upload health data through HBC-based human-machine interaction to an HBC capable machine. The system design constraints and signal transfer characteristics for the implemented HBC-based wearable health monitoring system are measured and analyzed, showing reliable connectivity with >8x power savings compared to Bluetooth lowenergy (BTLE).

"In this work, we demonstrate reconfigurable frequency manipulation of quantum states of light in the telecom C-band. Triggered single photons are encoded in a superposition state of three channels using sidebands up to 53 GHz created by an off-the-shelf phase modulator. The single photons are emitted by an InAs/GaAs quantum dot grown by metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy within the transparency window of the backbone fiber optical network. A cross-correlation measurement of the sidebands demonstrates the preservation of the single photon nature; an important prerequisite for future quantum technology applications using the existing telecommunication fiber network. "
"We present a combination of local density approximation (LDA) with the dynamical cluster approximation (LDA+DCA) in the framework of the full-potential linear augmented plane-wave method, and compare our LDA+DCA results for SrVO$_3$ to LDA with the dynamical mean field theory (LDA+DMFT) calculations as well as experimental observations on SrVO$_3$. We find a qualitative agreement of the momentum resolved spectral function with angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) and former LDA+DMFT results. As a correction to LDA+DMFT, we observe more pronounced coherent peaks below the Fermi level, as indicated by ARPES experiments. In addition, we resolve the spectral functions in the ${\bf K}_{0}=(0,0,0)$ and ${\bf K}_{1}=(\pi,\pi,\pi)$ sectors of DCA, where band insulating and metallic phases coexist. Our approach can be applied to correlated compounds where not only local quantum fluctuations but also spatial fluctuations are important. "
"In laser-driven wakefield, ionization induced injection is an efficient way to inject electrons in the plasma wave. A detailed study on the beam dynamics under the influence of beam loading effects, which can be controlled by the concentration of nitrogen impurity introduced in the hydrogen gas was conducted. For a specific value of this percentage, the final energy of the high-energy electron bunch becomes nearly independent of the trapped positions, thus leading to a small energy dispersion. We also show that the final beam emittance is mainly determined by the injection process. "
"The dynamical structure factor (S(Q,E)) of vitreous silica has been measured by Inelastic X-ray Scattering varying the exchanged wavevector (Q) at fixed exchanged energy (E) - an experimental procedure that, contrary to the usual one at constant Q, provides spectra with much better identified inelastic features. This allows the first direct evidence of Brillouin peaks in the S(Q,E) of SiO_2 at energies above the Boson Peak (BP) energy, a finding that excludes the possibility that the BP marks the transition from propagating to localised dynamics in glasses. "
"We study invariant Einstein metrics on the Stiefel manifold $V_k\mathbb{R}^n\cong \mathrm{SO}(n)/\mathrm{SO}(n-k)$ of all orthonormal $k$-frames in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The isotropy representation of this homogeneous space contains equivalent summands, so a complete description of $G$-invariant metrics is not easy. In this paper we view the manifold $V_{2p}\mathbb{R}^n$ as total space over a classical generalized flag manifolds with two isotropy summands and prove for $2\le p\le \frac25 n-1$ it admits at least four invariant Einstein metrics determined by $\mathrm{Ad}(\mathrm{U}(p) \times \mathrm{SO}(n-2p))$-invariant scalar products. Two of the metrics are Jensen's metrics and the other two are new Einstein metrics. "
This version is similar to math.CO/0210113. We've changed Conjectures 1.1 and 1.2 so that they cover arbitrary graphs(digraphs). Let G be an arbitrary graph(digraph). Then - in polynomial time - either an algorithm obtains a hamilton circuit(cycle)or else the algorithm points to at least one vertex that cannot belong to any hamilton circuit(cycle) of G. We give criteria for determining which vertices should be examined. 
"There have been significant innovations in media technologies in the recent years. While these developments have improved experiences for individual users, design of multi-user interfaces still remains a challenge. A relatively unexplored area in this context, is enabling multiple users to enjoy shared viewing (e.g. deciding on movies to watch together). In particular, the challenge is to design an intelligent system which would enable viewers to explore together shows or movies they like, seamlessly. This is a complex design problem, as it requires the system to (i) assess affinities of individual users (movies or genres), (ii) combine individual preferences taking into account user-user interactions, and (iii) be non-intrusive simultaneously. The proposed system VoCoG, is an end-to-end intelligent system for collaborative viewing. VoCoG incorporates an online recommendation algorithm, efficient methods for analyzing natural conversation and a graph-based method to fuse preferences of multiple users. It takes user conversation as input, making it non-intrusive. A usability survey of the system indicates that the system provides a good experience to the users as well as relevant recommendations. Further analysis of the usage data reveals insights about the nature of conversation during the interaction sessions, final consensus among the users as well as ratings of varied user groups. "
"In many extentions of standard model, dimension-5 scalar di-photon ($g_{\gamma\gamma\phi}\phi$ $F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$ ) or pseudoscalar di-photon ($g_{\gamma\gamma a}a\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} $, ) interaction materializes due to scale symmetry breaking or $U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking. In a magnetized vacuum (i.e., in an external background field $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu} $) the transverse degrees of freedom of the photons-- for such systems-- can be described in terms of the form factors constructed out of the background field strength tensor ($\bar{F}_{\mu\nu} $) and the same for dynamical photon ($f^{\mu\nu}$); they happen to be $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}$ and ${\tilde{\bar{F}}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}}$. These form factors transform differently under CP transformation. While $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}$ (describing polarization orthogonal to B ($|\gamma_{||} >$)) is CP even, the other one, ${\tilde{\bar{F}}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}}$( describing polarization along B ($|\gamma_\bot >$), is CP odd. In the interaction Lagrangian, if the scalar is interchanged with the pseudoscalar, the role of the two form factors just gets interchanged. Thus for nearly degenerate strengths of the coupling constants ( $g_{\gamma\gamma\phi}$ and $g_{\gamma\gamma _a}$ ) and masses ($m_\phi$ and $m_a$ ) of the respective candidates, proper identification of one from the other may become very difficult in laboratory or astrophysics based experiments. The basic motivation of this investigation is to reduce this uncertainty through incorporation of parity violating ({\it originating through magnetized medium effects }) part of the photon self-energy in the effective Lagrangian. This step, in turn affects the (Pseudo) Scalar Photon mixing dynamics drastically and brings out a significant change in the spectrum of the electromagnetic beam undergoing such interaction. "
"In this article, we illustrate the flexibility of the algebraic integration formalism introduced by M. Gubinelli (2004), by establishing an existence and uniqueness result for delay equations driven by rough paths. We then apply our results to the case where the driving path is a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H>1/3. "
"We show that the noncommutativity of space-time destroys the renormalizability of the 1/N expansion of the O(N) Gross-Neveu model. A similar statement holds for the noncommutative nonlinear sigma model. However, we show that, up to the subleading order in 1/N expansion, the noncommutative supersymmetric O(N) nonlinear sigma model becomes renormalizable in D=3. We also show that dynamical mass generation is restored and there is no catastrophic UV/IR mixing. Unlike the commutative case, we find that the Lagrange multiplier fields, which enforce the supersymmetric constraints, are also renormalized. For D=2 the divergence of the four point function of the basic scalar field, which in D=3 is absent, cannot be eliminated by means of a counterterm having the structure of a Moyal product. "
"Inspired by the recent observation of the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ by LHCb collaboration, we explore the ""decay constants"" of doubly heavy baryons in the framework of QCD sum rules. With the $\Xi_{cc}, \Xi_{bc}, \Xi_{bb}$, and $\Omega_{cc}, \Omega_{bc}, \Omega_{bb}$ baryons interpolated by three-quark operators, we calculate the correlation functions using the operator product expansion and include the contribution from operators up to dimension six. On the hadron side, we consider both contributions from the lowest-lying states with $J^P=1/2^+$ and from negative parity baryons with $J^P=1/2^-$. We find that the results are stable and the contaminations from negative parity baryons are not severe. These results are ingredients for the QCD study of weak decays and other properties of doubly-heavy baryons. "
We investigate the electrical conductivity(EC) of dense quark matter in the vicinity of the phase transition line. We show that: (i) At high density the Drude EC does not depend on the magnetic field up to $eB \sim 10^{19} \ G$. (ii) In the precritical region the fluctuation EC (paraconductivity) dominates over the Drude one. 
"We consider the information-theoretic optimality of treating inter-cell interference as noise in downlink cellular networks modeled as Gaussian interfering broadcast channels. Establishing a new uplink-downlink duality, we cast the problem in Gaussian interfering broadcast channels to that in Gaussian interfering multiple access channels, and characterize an achievable GDoF region under power control and treating inter-cell interference as (Gaussian) noise. We then identify conditions under which this achievable GDoF region is optimal. "
"In recent years, several Scientometrics and Bibliometrics indicators were proposed to evaluate the scientific impact of individuals, institutions, colleges, universities and research teams. The h-index gives a major breakthrough in the research community to evaluate the scientific impact of an individual. It got a lot of attention due to its simplicity and several other indicators were proposed to extend the properties of h-index as well as to overcome shortcomings of h-index. In this literature review, we have discussed the advantages and limitations of almost all Scientometrics as well as Bibliometrics indicators which have been categorized into seven categories :(i) Complement of h-index, (ii) Based on total number of authors, (iii) Based on publication age, (iv) Combination of two indices, (v) Based on excess citation count, (vi) Based on total publication count, (vii) Based on other variants. The main objective of this article is to study all those indicators which have been proposed to evaluate the scientific impact of an individual researcher or a group of researchers. "
"Mechanical metamaterials are artificial composites with tunable advanced mechanical properties. Particularly interesting types of mechanical metamaterials are flexible metamaterials, which harness internal rotations and instabilities to exhibit programmable deformations. However, to date such materials have mostly been considered using nearly purely elastic constituents such as neo-Hookean rubbers. Here we explore experimentally the mechanical snap-through response of metamaterials that are made of constituents that exhibit large viscoelastic relaxation effects, encountered in the vast majority of rubbers, in particular in 3D printed rubbers. We show that they exhibit a very strong sensitivity to the loading rate. In particular, the mechanical instability is strongly affected beyond a certain loading rate. We rationalize our findings with a compliant mechanism model augmented with viscoelastic interactions, which captures qualitatively well the reported behavior, suggesting that the sensitivity to loading rate stems from the nonlinear and inhomogeneous deformation rate, provoked by internal rotations. Our findings bring a novel understanding of metamaterials in the dynamical regime and opens up avenues for the use of metamaterials for dynamical shape-changing as well as vibration and impact damping applications. "
"We compute critical exponents of O(N) models in fractal dimensions between two and four, and for continuos values of the number of field components N, in this way completing the RG classification of universality classes for these models. In d=2 the N-dependence of the correlation length critical exponent gives us the last piece of information needed to establish a RG derivation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We also report critical exponents for multi-critical universality classes in the cases N>1 and N=0. Finally, in the large-N limit our critical exponents correctly approach those of the spherical model, allowing us to set N~100 as threshold for the quantitative validity of leading order large-N estimates. "
"We analyze one-particle inclusive DIS in the case when a spin-1 hadron (such as a vector meson) is observed in the final state. We consider only leading order contributions in 1/Q, but we include transverse momentum of partons. Several new fragmentation functions appear in cross sections. One of them can be measured in connection with the transverse-spin disbtribution function h_1. "
"We use cosmological N-body/gasdynamical simulations that include star formation and feedback to examine the proposal that scaling laws between the total luminosity, rotation speed, and angular momentum of disk galaxies reflect analogous correlations between the structural parameters of their surrounding dark matter halos. The numerical experiments follow the formation of galaxy-sized halos in two Cold Dark Matter dominated universes: the standard Omega=1 CDM scenario and the currently popular LCDM model. We find that the slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher relation are well reproduced in the simulations, although not, as proposed in recent work, as a result of the cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity: large systematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxies and in the ratio between halo and disk circular velocities are observed in our numerical experiments. The Tully-Fisher slope and scatter are recovered in this model as a direct result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly of the luminous component of the galaxy. We conclude that models that neglect the self-gravity of the disk and its influence on the detailed structure of the halo cannot be used to derive meaningful estimates of the scatter or slope of the Tully-Fisher relation. Our models fail, however, to match the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation, as well as that of the relation linking disk rotation speed and angular momentum. These failures can be traced, respectively, to the excessive central concentration of dark halos formed in the Cold Dark Matter cosmogonies we explore and to the formation of galaxy disks as the final outcome of a sequence of merger events.

The influence of a superconducting fault current limiter (FCL) on the transient stability of the synchronic operation of electric machines is analyzed for different locations of the inductive FCL in a network and for different parameters of the device. It is shown that the stability can be improved or degraded depending on the FCL impedance under a fault and the time of the recovery of the initial state of the limiter after a fault. Improving the transient stability with the inductive superconducting FCL is demonstrated in the experiments on the electrodynamic model of a power system. The expansion of the obtained results for other FCL designs is discussed. 
"Neuromorphic hardware platforms implement biological neurons and synapses to execute spiking neural networks (SNNs) in an energy-efficient manner. We present SpiNeMap, a design methodology to map SNNs to crossbar-based neuromorphic hardware, minimizing spike latency and energy consumption. SpiNeMap operates in two steps: SpiNeCluster and SpiNePlacer. SpiNeCluster is a heuristic-based clustering technique to partition SNNs into clusters of synapses, where intracluster local synapses are mapped within crossbars of the hardware and inter-cluster global synapses are mapped to the shared interconnect. SpiNeCluster minimizes the number of spikes on global synapses, which reduces spike congestion on the shared interconnect, improving application performance. SpiNePlacer then finds the best placement of local and global synapses on the hardware using a meta-heuristic-based approach to minimize energy consumption and spike latency. We evaluate SpiNeMap using synthetic and realistic SNNs on the DynapSE neuromorphic hardware. We show that SpiNeMap reduces average energy consumption by 45% and average spike latency by 21%, compared to state-of-the-art techniques. "
"Extra neutral gauge bosons suggested by models beyond the standard model can indirectly show up in $e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions through off-resonance deviations of various physical observables from the corresponding standard model values. We considered leptonic observables and studied the dependence of the deviations on the polarizations of the positron and electron beams. We showed that, for a given model, the magnitude of the deviation of a given observable can attain its maximum value if the polarizations of the positron and electron beams are properly chosen. We determined, for a given model, a single set of beam polarization so that if this set is employed in measuring all considered observables, it produces the highest extra gauge boson discovery limits.

"Recently, the higher-order Carlitz's q-Bernoulli polynomials are represented as q-Volkenborn integral on Zp by Kim. A question was asked in [13] as to finding the extended formulaeof symmetries for Bernoulli polynomials which are related to Carlitz q-Bernoulli polynomials. In this paper, we give some new identities of symmetry for the higher-order Carlitz q-Bernoulli polynomials whch are derived from multivariate q-Volkenborn integrals on Zp. We note that they are a partial answer to that question. . "

"We obtain a compactness result for various classes of Riemannian metrics in dimension four; in particular our method applies to anti-self-dual metrics, Kahler metrics with constant scalar curvature, and metrics with harmonic curvature. With certain geometric assumptions, the moduli space can be compactified by adding metrics with orbifold singularities. Similar results were obtained previously for Einstein metrics, but our analysis differs substantially from the Einstein case in that we do not assume any pointwise Ricci curvature bound. "
"Functional time series whose sample elements are recorded sequentially over time are frequently encountered with increasing technology. Recent studies have shown that analyzing and forecasting of functional time series can be performed easily using functional principal component analysis and existing univariate/multivariate time series models. However, the forecasting performance of such functional time series models may be affected by the presence of outlying observations which are very common in many scientific fields. Outliers may distort the functional time series model structure, and thus, the underlying model may produce high forecast errors. We introduce a robust forecasting technique based on weighted likelihood methodology to obtain point and interval forecasts in functional time series in the presence of outliers. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations and four real-data examples. Numerical results reveal that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared with the existing method(s). "
"We have implemented an experimental set-up in order to demonstrate the feasibility of time-coding protocols for quantum key distribution. Alice produces coherent 20 ns faint pulses of light at 853 nm. They are sent to Bob with delay 0 ns (encoding bit 0) or 10 ns (encoding bit 1). Bob directs at random the received pulses to two different arms. In the first one, a 300 ps resolution Si photon-counter allows Bob to precisely measure the detection times of each photon in order to establish the key. Comparing them with the emission times of the pulses sent by Alice allows to evaluate the quantum bit error rate (QBER). The minimum obtained QBER is 1.62 %. The possible loss of coherence in the set-up can be exploited by Eve to eavesdrop the line. Therefore, the second arm of Bob set-up is a Mach-Zender interferometer with a 10 ns propagation delay between the two path. Contrast measurement of the output beams allows to measure the autocorrelation function of the received pulses that characterizes their average coherence. In the case of an ideal set-up, the value expected with the pulses sent by Alice is 0.576. The experimental value of the pulses autocorrelation function is found to be 0.541. Knowing the resulting loss of coherence and the measured QBER, one can evaluate the mutual information between Alice and Eve and the mutual information between Alice and Bob, in the case of intercept-resend attacks and in the case of attacks with intrication. With our values, Bob has an advantage on Eve of 0.43 bit per pulse. The maximum possible QBER corresponding to equal informations for Bob and Eve is 5.8 %. With the usual attenuation of fibres at 850 nm, it shows that secure key distribution is possible up to a distance of 2.75 km, which is sufficient for local links. "
"We show that the $\sigma/f_0(500)$ state with finite-temperature $T$ corrections to its spectral properties included, plays an essential role for the description of the scalar susceptibility $\chi_S$, signaling chiral symmetry restoration. First, we use the $O(4)$ Linear Sigma Model as a testbed to derive the connection between $\chi_S$ and the $\sigma$ propagator and to check the validity and reliability of the approach where $\chi_S$ is saturated by the $\sigma/f_0(500)$ inverse self-energy, which we calculate at finite $T$ to one loop. A more accurate phenomenological description is achieved by considering the saturation approach as given by the thermal $f_0(500)$ state generated in Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory. Such approach allows to describe fairly well recent lattice data within the uncertainty range given by the UChPT parameters. Finally, we compare the UChPT saturated description with one based on the Hadron Resonance Gas, for which the hadron mass dependences are extracted from recent theoretical analysis. Several fits to lattice data are performed, which confirm the validity of the thermal $f_0(500)$ saturated approach and hence the importance of that thermal state for chiral symmetry restoration. "
"Many biological and chemical systems exhibit collective behavior in response to the change in their population density. These elements or cells communicate with each other via dynamical agents or signaling molecules. In this work, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear oscillators, specifically Stuart-Landau oscillators and Rayleigh oscillators, interacting globally through dynamical agents in the surrounding environment modeled as a quorum sensing interaction. The system exhibits the typical continuous second-order transition from oscillatory state to death state, when the oscillation amplitude is small. However, interestingly, when the amplitude of oscillations is large we find that the system shows an abrupt transition from oscillatory to death state, a transition termed ""explosive death"". So the quorum-sensing form of interaction can induce the usual second-order transition, as well as sudden first-order transitions. Further in case of the explosive death transitions, the oscillatory state and the death state coexist over a range of coupling strengths near the transition point. This emergent regime of hysteresis widens with increasing strength of the mean-field feedback, and is relevant to hysteresis that is widely observed in biological, chemical and physical processes. "
"We present an experimental demonstration as well as a theoretical model of an integrated circuit designed for the manipulation of a microwave field down to the single-photon level. The device is made of a superconducting resonator coupled to a transmission line via a second frequency-tunable resonator. The tunable resonator can be used as a tunable coupler between the fixed resonator and the transmission line. Moreover, the manipulation of the microwave field between the two resonators is possible. In particular, we demonstrate the swapping of the field from one resonator to the other by pulsing the frequency detuning between the two resonators. The behavior of the system, which determines how the device can be operated, is analyzed as a function of one key parameter of the system, the damping ratio of the coupled resonators. We show a good agreement between experiments and simulations, realized by solving a set of coupled differential equations. "
"The increase in data collection has made data annotation an interesting and valuable task in the contemporary world. This paper presents a new methodology for quickly annotating data using click-supervision and hierarchical object detection. The proposed work is semi-automatic in nature where the task of annotations is split between the human and a neural network. We show that our improved method of annotation reduces the time, cost and mental stress on a human annotator. The research also highlights how our method performs better than the current approach in different circumstances such as variation in number of objects, object size and different datasets. Our approach also proposes a new method of using object detectors making it suitable for data annotation task. The experiment conducted on PASCAL VOC dataset revealed that annotation created from our approach achieves a mAP of 0.995 and a recall of 0.903. The Our Approach has shown an overall improvement by 8.5%, 18.6% in mean average precision and recall score for KITTI and 69.6%, 36% for CITYSCAPES dataset. The proposed framework is 3-4 times faster as compared to the standard annotation method. "
"We give a simple and direct treatment of the strong convergence of quantum random walks to quantum stochastic operator cocycles, via the semigroup decomposition of such cocycles. Our approach also delivers convergence of the pointwise product of quantum random walks to the quantum stochastic Trotter product of the respective limit cocycles, thereby revealing the algebraic structure of the limiting procedure. The repeated quantum interactions model is shown to fit nicely into the convergence scheme described. "
"Multivariate spatial field data are increasingly common and whose modeling typically relies on building cross-covariance functions to describe cross-process relationships. An alternative viewpoint is to model the matrix of spectral measures. We develop the notions of coherence, phase and gain for multidimensional stationary processes. Coherence, as a function of frequency, can be seen to be a measure of linear relationship between two spatial processes at that frequency band. We use the coherence function to illustrate fundamental limitations on a number of previously proposed constructions for multivariate processes, suggesting these options are not viable for real data. We also give natural interpretations to cross-covariance parameters of the Matern class, where the smoothness indexes dependence at low frequencies while the range parameter can imply dependence at low or high frequencies. Estimation follows from smoothed multivariate periodogram matrices. We illustrate the estimation and interpretation of these functions on two datasets, forecast and reanalysis sea level pressure and geopotential heights over the equatorial region. Examining these functions lends insight that would otherwise be difficult to detect and model using standard cross-covariance formulations. "
"We study a theoretical model of closed quasi-hermitian chain of spins which exhibits quantum analogues of chimera states, i.e. long life classical states for which a part of an oscillator chain presents an ordered dynamics whereas another part presents a disordered chaotic dynamics. For the quantum analogue, the chimera behavior deals with the entanglement between the spins of the chain. We discuss the entanglement properties, quantum chaos, quantum disorder and semi-classical similarity of our quantum chimera system. The quantum chimera concept is novel and induces new perspectives concerning the entanglement of multipartite systems. "
"Discrete derived categories were studied initially by Vossieck \cite{Vossieck} and later by Bobi\'nski, Gei\ss, Skowro\'nski \cite{BGS}. In this article, we define the CW complex of silting pairs for a triangulated category and show that it is contractible in the case of discrete derived categories. We provide an explicit embedding from the silting CW complex into the stability manifold. By work of Qiu and Woolf, there is a deformation retract of the stability manifold onto the silting pairs CW complex. We obtain that the space of stability conditions of discrete derived categories is contractible. "
"In this work, we present new soliton solutions for thick branes in $4+1$ dimensions. In particular, we consider brane models based on the sine-Gordon ($SG$), $\varphi^{4}$ and $\varphi^{6}$ scalar fields, which have broken $Z_{2}$ symmetry in some cases, and are responsible for supporting and stabilizing the thick branes. The origin of the symmetry breaking in these models resides in the fact that the modified scalar field potential may have non-degenerate vacuua. These vacuua determine the cosmological constant on both sides of the brane. We also study the geodesic equations along the fifth dimension, in order to explore the particle motion in the neighbourhood of the brane. Furthermore, we examine the stability of the thick branes, by determining the sign of the $w^2$ term in the expansion of the potential for the resulting Schrodinger-like equation, where $w$ is the 5-dimensional coordinate. It turns out that the $\varphi^4$ brane is stable, while there are unstable modes for certain ranges of the model parameters in the SG and $\varphi^6$ branes. "
"We present in this paper an exact study concerning a first order transition induced by an inhomogeneous boundary magnetic field in the 2D Ising model. From a previous analysis of the interfacial free energy in the discrete case (J. Phys. A, 2849, 2005), we identify, using an asymptotic expansion in the thermodynamic limit, the transition line that separates the regime where the interface is localised near the boundary from the regime where it is propagating inside the bulk. In particular, the critical line has a strong dependence on the aspect ratio of the lattice. "
"The geometry of a light wavefront, evolving from a initial flat wavefront in the 3-space associated with a post-Newtonian relativistic spacetime, is studied numerically by means of the ray tracing method. For a discretization of the bidimensional light wavefront, a surface fitting technique is used to determine the curvature of this surface. The relationship between the intrinsic curvature of the wavefront and the change of the arrival time at different points on the Earth is also numerically discussed. "
"We investigate the possibility to suppress noise-induced intensity pulsations (relaxation oscillations) in semiconductor lasers by means of a time-delayed feedback control scheme. This idea is first studied in a generic normal form model, where we derive an analytic expression for the mean amplitude of the oscillations and demonstrate that it can be strongly modulated by varying the delay time. We then investigate the control scheme analytically and numerically in a laser model of Lang-Kobayashi type and show that relaxation oscillations excited by noise can be very efficiently suppressed via feedback from a Fabry-Perot resonator. "
"As part of our program to map the large-scale distribution of galaxies behind the Milky Way, we used the Parkes 210 ft (64 m) radio telescope for pointed HI observations of a sample of low surface-brightness (due to heavy obscuration) spiral galaxies selected from the deep optical Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) galaxy catalog in the Hydra/Antlia region (Kraan-Korteweg 2000a). Searching a simultaneous velocity range of either 300 to 5500 km/s or 300 to 10500 km/s to an rms level of typically 2 - 4 mJy resulted in detections in 61 of the 139 pointings, leading to a total of 66 detections (an additional detection was made in a reference position, and two other pointings revealed two and four independent signals respectively). Except for 2 strong HI emitters identified in the shallow Zone of Avoidance HI survey (Henning et al. 2000), all HI detections are new. An analysis of the properties of the observed and detected galaxies prove that pointed HI observations of highly obscured galaxies allow the tracing of a population of nearby, intrinsically large and bright spiral galaxies that otherwise would not be recovered. The new data identified a previously unrecognized nearby group at l=287.5, b=-9.5, V=1700 km/s, the continuation of the Hydra/Antlia filament on the opposite side of the Galactic plane, and helped to delimit a distinct void in the ZOA centered at 2000 km/s.

"Diacritization of Arabic text is both an interesting and a challenging problem at the same time with various applications ranging from speech synthesis to helping students learning the Arabic language. Like many other tasks or problems in Arabic language processing, the weak efforts invested into this problem and the lack of available (open-source) resources hinder the progress towards solving this problem. This work provides a critical review for the currently existing systems, measures and resources for Arabic text diacritization. Moreover, it introduces a much-needed free-for-all cleaned dataset that can be easily used to benchmark any work on Arabic diacritization. Extracted from the Tashkeela Corpus, the dataset consists of 55K lines containing about 2.3M words. After constructing the dataset, existing tools and systems are tested on it. The results of the experiments show that the neural Shakkala system significantly outperforms traditional rule-based approaches and other closed-source tools with a Diacritic Error Rate (DER) of 2.88% compared with 13.78%, which the best DER for the non-neural approach (obtained by the Mishkal tool). "
"Motivated by the emittance requirements for future light sources, we show how longitudinal-transverse correlations can be introduced to create beams with large emittance asymmetry. This concept generalizes a key aspect of a Flat Beam Transform, which introduces initial correlations among the transverse planes, to systems with initial longitudinal-transverse correlations. We present an eigen-emittance formalism to analyze such systems. We illustrate the approach by analyzing an electron beam emitted from a photoinjector utilizing a laser with a tilted pulse front. This approach can be used to design beam delivery systems that achieve extraordinarily transversely bright electron beams. "
"Let F be a non-Archimedean local field of residual characteristic p, and $\ell$ be a prime number different from p. We consider the local Jacquet-Langlands correspondence between $\ell$-adic discrete series of GL(n,F) and an inner form GL(m,D). We show that it respects the relationship of congruence modulo $\ell$. More precisely, we show that two integral $\ell$-adic discrete series of GL(m,D) are congruent modulo $\ell$ if and only if the same holds for their Jacquet-Langlands transfers to GL(m,D). "
We study localization in two- and three channel quasi-1D systems using multichain tight-binding Anderson models with nearest-neighbour interchain hopping. In the three chain case we discuss both the case of free- and that of periodic boundary conditions between the chains. The finite disordered wires are connected to ideal leads and the localization length is defined from the Landauer conductance in terms of the transmission coefficients matrix. The transmission- and reflection amplitudes in properly defined quantum channels are obtained from S-matrices constructed from transfer matrices in Bloch wave bases for the various quasi-1D systems. Our exact analytic expressions for localization lengths for weak disorder reduce to the Thouless expression for 1D systems in the limit of vanishing interchain hopping. For weak interchain hopping the localization length decreases with respect to the 1D value in all three cases. In the three-channel cases it increases with interchain hopping over restricted domains of large hopping. 
"The study of entire holomorphic curves contained in projective algebraic varieties is intimately related to fascinating questions of geometry and number theory -- especially through the concepts of curvature and positivity which are central themes in Kodaira's contributions to mathematics. The aim of these lectures is to present recent results concerning the geometric side of the problem. The Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture stipulates that for every projective variety $X$ of general type over $\mathbb{C}$, there exists a proper algebraic subvariety $Y$ of $X$ containing all non constant entire curves $f:\mathbb{C}\to X$. Using the formalism of directed varieties and jet bundles, we show that this assertion holds true in case $X$ satisfies a strong general type condition that is related to a certain jet-semistability property of the tangent bundle $T_X$. It is possible to exploit similar techniques to investigate a famous conjecture of Shoshichi Kobayashi (1970), according to which a generic algebraic hypersurface of dimension $n$ and of sufficiently large degree $d\ge d_n$ in the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ is hyperbolic: in the early 2000's, Yum-Tong Siu proposed a strategy that led in 2015 to a proof based on a clever use of slanted vector fields on jet spaces, combined with Nevanlinna theory arguments. In 2016, the conjecture has been settled in a different way by Damian Brotbek, making a more direct use of Wronskian differential operators and associated multiplier ideals; shortly afterwards, Ya Deng showed how the proof could be modified to yield an explicit value of $d_n$. We give here a short proof based on a drastic simplification of their ideas, along with a further improvement of Deng's bound, namely $d_n=\lfloor\frac{1}{5}(en)^{2n+2}\rfloor$. "
"A short introduction on quantum thermodynamics is given and three new topics are discussed: 1) Maximal work extraction from a finite quantum system. The thermodynamic prediction fails and a new, general result is derived, the ``ergotropy''. 2) In work extraction from two-temperature setups, the presence of correlations can push the effective efficiency beyond the Carnot bound. 3) In the presence of level crossing, non-slow changes may be more optimal than slow ones. "
"We present T-ReCS high spatial resolution N-band (8-13 micron) spectroscopy of the central regions (a few kpc) of 3 local LIRGs. The nuclear spectra show deep 9.7 micron silicate absorption feature and the high ionization [SIV]10.5 micron emission line, consistent with their optical classification as AGN. The two LIRGs with unresolved mid-IR emission do not show PAH emission at 11.3 micron in their nuclear spectra. The spatially resolved mid-IR spectroscopy of NGC 5135 allows us to separate out the spectra of the Seyfert nucleus, an HII region, and the diffuse region between them on scales of less than 2.5 arcsec ~ 600 pc. The diffuse region spectrum is characterized by strong PAH emission with almost no continuum, whereas the HII region shows PAH emission with a smaller equivalent width as well as [NeII]12.8 micron line. "
"A phase modulated RF current source is applied to an injection locked diode laser operating at $780\unit{nm}$. This produces tunable phase modulated sidebands of the laser suitable for stabilizing the length of an optical transfer cavity using the Pound-Drever-Hall technique. The Pound-Drever-Hall signal is anti-symmetric about the lock point, despite the presence of significant diode laser amplitude modulation. The stabilized optical transfer cavity is used to frequency stabilize a 776 nm external cavity diode laser. The stability and tunability of this transfer cavity locked laser is established by observation of the hyperfine components of the $^{87}$Rb $5P_{3/2}-5D_{5/2}$ transition in a vapor cell. "
"Based on first-principles calculations, the evolution of the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal dihalides MX$_2$ (M= V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; X = Cl, Br, I) is analyzed from the bulk to the monolayer limit. A variety of magnetic ground states is obtained as a result of the competition between direct exchange and superexchange. The results predict that FeX$_2$, NiX$_2$, CoCl$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers are ferromagnetic insulators with sizable magnetocrystalline anisotropies. This makes them ideal candidates for robust ferromagnetism at the single layer level. Our results also highlight the importance of spin-orbit coupling to obtain the correct ground state. "
"The construction of finite tight Gabor frames plays an important role in many applications. These applications include significant ones in signal and image processing. We explore when constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences can be used to generate tight Gabor frames. The main theorem uses Janssen's representation and the zeros of the discrete periodic ambiguity function to give necessary and sufficient conditions for determining whether any Gabor frame is tight. The relevance of the theorem depends significantly on the construction of examples. These examples are necessarily intricate, and to a large extent, depend on CAZAC sequences. Finally, we present an alternative method for determining whether a Gabor system yields a tight frame. This alternative method does not prove tightness using the main theorem, but instead uses the Gram matrix of the Gabor system. "
We present Doppler and modulation tomography of the low-mass X-ray binary V691 CrA with data obtained using the 6.5-m Magellan Baade telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in 2010 and 2011. The disc and hotspot are observed in H\alpha and He II (\lambda 4686) in both years. A clear image of the disc is seen in He II (\lambda 5411) using the 2010 data. We present the first tomography of the absorption line He I (\lambda 5876) and detect absorption near the L_1 point of the donor star. We also present the first modulation tomography of the emission line H\alpha and detect emission from the secondary. The H\alpha double peaks are imbedded in a deep absorption trough confirming the presence of Balmer line absorbing material in the system. Our observations of H\alpha show absorption in a larger phase range than in H\beta which could be due to heating up of sprayed matter from the hotspot as it travels downstream. We also suggest possible occultation of the H\alpha absorbing spray by the disc bulge at certain phases. 
"We use a density matrix renormalization group method to study quantitatively the phase diagram of a one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling by investigating the correlation functions and structure factors. We confirm the existence of a novel narrow region with long-rang bond-order-wave order which is highly controversial recently between the charge-density-wave phase and Mott insulator phase. We determined accurately the position of the tricritical point $U_t\simeq 7.2t$, $V_t\simeq 3.746t$ which is quite different from previous studies. "
"High-energy {\gamma}-rays, which are produced by powerful relativistic jets, are usually associated with blazars and radio galaxies. In the current active galactic nuclei (AGN) paradigm, such jets are almost exclusively launched from massive elliptical galaxies. Recently, however, Fermi/LAT detected {\gamma}-rays from a few narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and thus confirmed the presence of relativistic jets in them. Since NLS1 galaxies are assumed to be young evolving AGN, they offer a unique opportunity to study the production of relativistic jets in late-type galaxies. Our aim is to estimate by which processes the emission of various kinds is produced in NLS1 galaxies and to study how emission properties are connected to other intrinsic AGN properties. We have compiled the so far largest multiwavelength database of NLS1 sources. This allowed us to explore correlations between different wavebands and source properties using, for example, Pearson and Spearman correlations and principal component analysis. We did this separately for radio-loud and radio-quiet sources. Multiwavelength correlations suggest that radio-loud sources host relativistic jets that are the predominant sources of radio, optical, and X-ray emission. The origin of infrared emission remains unclear. Radio-quiet sources do not host a jet, or the jet is very weak. In them, radio and infrared emission is more likely generated via star formation processes, and the optical and X-ray emission originate in the inner parts of the AGN. We also find that the black hole mass correlates significantly with radio loudness, which suggests that NLS1 galaxies with more massive black holes are more likely to be able to launch powerful relativistic jets. "
"We study the low temperature static and dynamical properties of the classical bond-disordered antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. This model has recently been shown to host a new type of spin liquid exhibiting an exponentially large number of discrete ground states. Surprisingly, despite the rigidity of the groundstates, we establish the vanishing of the corresponding spin stiffness. Locally, the low-lying eigenvectors of the Hessian appear to exhibit a fractal inverse participation ratio. Its spin dynamics resembles that of Coulomb Heisenberg spin liquids, but exhibits a new low-temperature dynamically arrested regime, which however gets squeezed out with increasing system size. We also probe the properties of the energy landscape underpinning this behaviour, and find energy barriers between distinct ground states vanishing with system size. In turn the local minima appear highly connected and the system tends to lose memory of its inital state in an accumulation of soft directions. "
A short proof is given for the well-known Choi-Effros theorem on the structure of ranges of completely positive projections. 
"Characterization of the morphology of strongly lensed galaxies is challenging because images of such galaxies are typically highly distorted. Lens modeling and source plane reconstruction is one approach that can provide reasonably undistorted images from which morphological measurements can be made, although at the expense of a highly spatially variable telescope PSF when mapped back to the source plane. Unfortunately, modeling the lensing mass is a time and resource intensive process, and in many cases there are too few constraints to precisely model the lensing mass. If, however, useful morphological measurements could be made in the image plane rather than the source plane, it would bypass this issue and obviate the need for a source reconstruction process for some applications. We examine the use of the Gini coefficient as one such measurement. Because it depends on the cumulative distribution of the light of a galaxy, but not the relative spatial positions, the fact that surface brightness is conserved by lensing means that the Gini coefficient may be well-preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Through simulations, we test the extent to which the Gini coefficient is conserved, including by effects due to PSF convolution and pixelization, to determine whether it is invariant enough under lensing to be used as a measurement of galaxy morphology that can be made in the image plane. "
We present the natural arguments for the rationality of a recently proposed simple approach for renormalization which is based solving differential equations. The renormalization group equation is also derived in a natural way and recognized as a decoupling theorem of the UV modes that underlie a QFT. This new strategy has direct implications to the scheme dependence problem. 
"We investigate the large scale cosmological perturbation in the Universe with multiple perfect fluids. Using the long-wavelength approximation with Hamilton-Jacobi method, we derive the formula for the gauge invariant comoving curvature perturbation. As an application of our approach, we examine the large scale perturbation in a brane cosmology. "
"Motivated by the study of area laws for the entanglement entropy of gapped ground states of quantum spin systems and their stability, we prove that the unitary cocycle generated by a local time-dependent Hamiltonian can be approximated, for any finite set $X$, by a tensor product of the corresponding unitaries in $X$ and its complement, multiplied by a dynamics strictly supported in the neighbourhood of the surface $\partial X$. The error decays almost exponentially in the size of the neighbourhood and grows with the square of the area~$\vert \partial X\vert^2$. "
"Given a set of integers with no three in arithmetic progression, we construct a Stanley sequence by adding integers greedily so that no arithmetic progression is formed. This paper offers two main contributions to the theory of Stanley sequences. First, we characterize well-structured Stanley sequences as solutions to constraints in modular arithmetic, defining the modular Stanley sequences. Second, we introduce the basic Stanley sequences, where elements arise as the sums of subsets of a basis sequence, which in the simplest case is the powers of 3. Applications of our results include the construction of Stanley sequences with arbitrarily large gaps between terms, answering a weak version of a problem by Erd\H{o}s et al. Finally, we generalize many results about Stanley sequences to $p$-free sequences, where $p$ is any odd prime. "
"In the framework of the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) project, a HARPSpol Large Program at the 3.6m-ESO telescope has recently started to collect high-resolution spectropolarimetric data of a large number of Southern massive OB stars in the field of the Galaxy and in many young clusters and associations. In this Letter, we report on the first discoveries of magnetic fields in two massive stars with HARPSpol - HD 130807 and HD 122451, and confirm the presence of a magnetic field at the surface of HD 105382 that was previously observed with a low spectral resolution device. The longitudinal magnetic field measurements are strongly varying for HD 130807 from $\sim$-100 G to $\sim$700 G. Those of HD 122451 and HD 105382 are less variable with values ranging from $\sim$-40 to -80 G, and from $\sim$-300 to -600 G, respectively. The discovery and confirmation of three new magnetic massive stars, including at least two He-weak stars, is an important contribution to one of the MiMeS objectives: the understanding of origin of magnetic fields in massive stars and their impacts on stellar structure and evolution. "
"Spectral analysis in conjunction with discrete data in one and more dimensions can become a challenging task, because the methods are sometimes difficult to understand. This paper intends to provide an overview about the usage of the Fourier transform, its related methods and focuses on the subtleties to which the users must pay attention. Typical questions, which are often addressed to the data, will be discussed. Such a problem can be the issue of frequency or band limitation of the signal. Or the source of artifacts might be of interest, when a Fourier transform is carried out. Another topic is the issue with fragmented data. Here, the Lomb-Scargle method will be explained with an illustrative example to deal with this special type of signal. Furthermore, a challenge encountered very often is the time-dependent spectral analysis, with which one can evaluate the point in time when a certain frequency appears in the signal. The information to solve such problems and to answer this questions is spread over many disciplines ranging from mathematics, electrical engineering, economic science to astrophysics. The goal of the first part of this paper is to collect the important information about the common methods to give the reader a guide on how to use these for application on one-dimensional data. The second part of this paper will then address the two- and more-dimensional data. The introduced methods are supported by the spectral package, which has been published for the statistical environment R prior this article. "
Every knot can be unknotted with two generalized twists; this was first proved by Ohyama. Here we prove that any knot of genus g can be unknotted with 2g null-homologous twists and that there exist genus g knots that cannot be unknotted with fewer than 2g null-homologous twists. 
"I present a total of 98.8 ksec ($\sim$ 3$\times$30 ksec) observation of T Pyx with the ACIS-S3 detector on-board the $Chandra$ Observatory obtained during the quiescent phase, about 2-3 months before its outburst in April 2011. The total $Chandra$ spectrum of the source T Pyx gives a maximum temperature kT$_{max}$$>$ 37.0 keV with (0.9-1.5)$\times 10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (1.3-2.2)$\times$10$^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 3.5 kpc) in the 0.1-50 keV range using a multi-temperature plasma emission model (i.e., CEVMKL in XSPEC). I find a ratio of (L$_{x}$/L$_{disk}$)$\simeq$(2-7)$\times$10$^{-4}$ indicating considerable inefficiency of emission in the boundary layer. There is no blackbody emission with 2$\sigma$ upper limits kT$_{BB}$$<$ 25 eV and L$_{soft}$$<$ 2.0$\times$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-10.0 keV band. All fits yield only interstellar N${\rm _H}$ during quiescence. I suggest that T Pyx has an optically thin boundary layer (BL) merged with an ADAF-like flow (Advection-Dominated Flow) and/or X-ray corona in the inner disk indicating ongoing quasi-spherical accretion at (very) high rates during quiescent phases. Such a BL structure may be excessively heating the WD, influencing the thermonuclear runaway leading to the recurrent nova events. The central source (i.e., the binary system) emission and its spectrum is deconvolved with a detailed procedure at the sub-pixel level revealing an extended emission with S/N $\sim$6-10. The derived shape looks like an elliptical nebula with a semi-major axis $\sim$1.0 arc sec and a semi-minor axis $\sim$0.5 arc sec. The calculated approximate count rate of the extended emission is 0.0013-0.0025 c s$^{-1}$. The luminosity of the nebula is $\sim$(0.6-30.0)$\times$10$^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The nebulosity seems consistent with an interaction of the outflow/ejecta from the 1966 outburst. "
"Using SU(3) symmetry to constrain the pion BB' couplings, assuming SU(3) breaking comes only from one-loop pion cloud contributions, and using the the covariant spectator theory to describe the photon coupling to the quark core, we show how the experimental masses and magnetic moments of the baryon octet can be used to set a model independent constraint on the strength of the pion cloud contributions to the octet, and hence the nucleon, form factors at Q2=0. "
"We study ballistic transport of spin-polarized electrons through quantum wires in which the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is spatially modulated. Subband mixing, due to SOI, between the two lowest subbands is taken into account. Simplified approximate expressions for the transmission are obtained for electron energies close to the bottom of the first subband and near the value for which anticrossing of the two lowest subbands occurs. In structures with periodically varied SOI strength, {\it square-wave} modulation on the spin transmission is found when only one subband is occupied and its possible application to the spin transistor is discussed. When two subbands are occupied the transmission is strongly affected by the existence of SOI interfaces as well as by the subband mixing. "
"Gamma rays and neutrons, emitted following spontaneous fission of 252Cf, were measured in an AGATA experiment performed at INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro in Italy. The setup consisted of four AGATA triple cluster detectors (12 36-fold segmented high-purity germanium crystals), placed at a distance of 50 cm from the source, and 16 HELENA BaF2 detectors. The aim of the experiment was to study the interaction of neutrons in the segmented high-purity germanium detectors of AGATA and to investigate the possibility to discriminate neutrons and gamma rays with the gamma-ray tracking technique. The BaF2 detectors were used for a time-of-flight measurement, which gave an independent discrimination of neutrons and gamma rays and which was used to optimise the gamma-ray tracking-based neutron rejection methods. It was found that standard gamma-ray tracking, without any additional neutron rejection features, eliminates effectively most of the interaction points due to recoiling Ge nuclei after elastic scattering of neutrons. Standard tracking rejects also a significant amount of the events due to inelastic scattering of neutrons in the germanium crystals. Further enhancements of the neutron rejection was obtained by setting conditions on the following quantities, which were evaluated for each event by the tracking algorithm: energy of the first and second interaction point, difference in the calculated incoming direction of the gamma ray, figure-of-merit value. The experimental results of tracking with neutron rejection agree rather well with Geant4 simulations. "
We present a model of single species fishery which alternates closed seasons with pulse captures. The novelty is that the length of a closed season is determined by the stock size of the last capture. The process is described by a new type of impulsive differential equations recently introduced. The main result is a fishing effort threshold which determines either the sustainability of the fishery or the extinction of the resource. 
"We develop a computational method based on an Eulerian field called the ""reference map"", which relates the current location of a material point to its initial. The reference map can be discretized to permit finite-difference simulation of large solid-like deformations, in any dimension, of the type that might otherwise require the finite element method. The generality of the method stems from its ability to easily compute kinematic quantities essential to solid mechanics, that are elusive outside of Lagrangian frame. This introductory work focuses on large-strain, hyperelastic materials. After a brief review of hyperelasticity, a discretization of the method is presented and some non-trivial elastic deformations are simulated, both static and dynamic. The method's accuracy is directly verified against known analytical solutions. "
"We give a distance estimate for the metric on the disk complex and show that it is Gromov hyperbolic. As another application of our techniques, we find an algorithm which computes the Hempel distance of a Heegaard splitting, up to an error depending only on the genus. "
"We obtain an upper bound on the minimal number of points in an $\eps$-chain joining two points in a metric space. This generalizes a bound due to Hambly and Kumagai (1999) for the case of resistance metric on certain self-similar fractals. As an application, we deduce a condition on $\eps$-chains introduced by Grigor'yan and Telcs (2012). This allows us to obtain sharp bounds on the heat kernel for spaces satisfying the parabolic Harnack inequality without assuming further conditions on the metric. A snowflake transform on the Euclidean space shows that our bound is sharp. "
We investigate the rational approximation of fractional powers of unbounded positive operators attainable with a specific integral representation of the operator function. We provide accurate error bounds by exploiting classical results in approximation theory involving Pad\'{e} approximants. The analysis improves some existing results and the numerical experiments proves its accuracy. 
"Three types of BaTiO3 core - amorphous nano-shell composite ceramics were processed from the same core-shell powder by standard sintering, spark-plasma sintering and two-step sintering techniques and characterized by XRD, HRSEM and broad-band dielectric spectroscopy in the frequency range 10^3 - 10^13 Hz including the THz and IR range. The samples differed by porosity and by the amount of interdiffusion from the cores to shells, in correlation with their increasing porosity. The dielectric spectra were also calculated using suitable models based on effective medium approximation. The measurements revealed a strong dielectric dispersion below the THz range, which cannot be explained by the modeling, and whose strength was in correlation with the degree of interdiffusion. We assigned it to an effect of the interdiffusion layers, giving rise to a strong interfacial polarization. It appears that the high-frequency dielectric spectroscopy is an extremely sensitive tool for detection of any gradient layers and sample inhomogeneities even in dielectric materials with negligible conductivity. "
Honesty has never been scientifically proved to be the best policy in any case. It is pointed out that only honest person can prevent his dishonest partner to bias the outcome of quantum coin tossing. 
"Due to the flexibility and adaptability of human, manual handling work is still very important in industry, especially for assembly and maintenance work. Well-designed work operation can improve work efficiency and quality; enhance safety, and lower cost. Most traditional methods for work system analysis need physical mock-up and are time consuming. Digital mockup (DMU) and digital human modeling (DHM) techniques have been developed to assist ergonomic design and evaluation for a specific worker population (e.g. 95 percentile); however, the operation adaptability and adjustability for a specific individual are not considered enough. In this study, a new framework based on motion tracking technique and digital human simulation technique is proposed for motion-time analysis of manual operations. A motion tracking system is used to track a worker's operation while he/she is conducting a manual handling work. The motion data is transferred to a simulation computer for real time digital human simulation. The data is also used for motion type recognition and analysis either online or offline for objective work efficiency evaluation and subjective work task evaluation. Methods for automatic motion recognition and analysis are presented. Constraints and limitations of the proposed method are discussed. "
"The responsivity and noise of a voltage-biased superconducting transition-edge sensor depends strongly on the details of its thermal model, and the simplest theory for TES response assumes a single heat capacity connected to the heat bath. Here, analytical results are derived and discussed for the complex impedance, the responsivity and the noise of a transition-edge sensor, when the thermal model is not simple but consists of either two or three connected heat capacities. The implications of the differences of the models are discussed, as well. "
The incorporation site of Er dopants inserted at high and low concentration (respectively 5 and 0.5 mol %) in nanoparticles of CaF 2 is studied by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the Er L III edge. The experimental data are compared with the results of structural modeling based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). DFT-based molecular dynamics is also used to simulate complete theoretical EXAFS spectra of the model structures. The results is that Er substitutes for Ca in the structure and in the low concentration case the dopant ions are isolated. At high concentration the rare earth ions cluster together binding Ca vacancies. 
"Mirror Symmetry, Picard-Fuchs equations and instanton corrected Yukawa couplings are discussed within the framework of toric geometry. It allows to establish mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau spaces for which the mirror manifold had been unavailable in previous constructions. Mirror maps and Yukawa couplings are explicitly given for several examples with two and three moduli. "
"We derive stringent constraints on the persistent source associated with FRB 121102: Size $10^{17}$ cm $<R<10^{18}$ cm, age $<300$ yr, characteristic electron energy $\varepsilon_e\sim0.3$ GeV, total energy $\sim10^{49}$ erg. The hot radiating plasma is confined by a cold plasma of mass $M_c<0.03 (R/10^{17.5}{\rm cm})^4 M_\odot$. The source is nearly resolved, and may be resolved by 10 GHz observations. The fact that $\varepsilon_e\sim m_p c^2$ suggests that the hot plasma was created by the ejection of a mildly relativistic, $M\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ shell, which propagated into an extended ambient medium or collided with a pre-ejected shell of mass $M_c$. The inferred plasma properties are inconsistent with typical ""magnetar wind nebulae"" model predictions. We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of FRBs (independent of the persistent source model): Ejection from an underlying compact object, $R_s\sim10^{6}$ cm, of highly relativistic shells, with energy $E_s=10^{41}$ erg and Lorentz factor $\gamma_s$~$10^3$, into a surrounding e-p plasma with density $n\sim0.1/cm^3$ (consistent with that inferred for the plasma producing the persistent emission associated with FRB 121102). Such shell ejections with energy typical for FRB events lead to plasma conditions appropriate for strong synchrotron maser emission at the GHz range, $\nu_{ coh.}\sim0.5(E/10^{41}erg)^{1/4}$ GHz. In this model, a significant fraction of the deposited energy is converted to an FRB with duration $R_s/c$, accompanied by ~10 MeV photons carrying less energy than the FRB. The inferred energy and mass associated with the source are low compared to those of typical supernova ejecta. This may suggest some type of a ""weak stellar explosion"", where a neutron star is formed with relatively low mass and energy ejection. However, the current upper limit on R does not allow one to rule out $M_c\sim1M_\odot$. "
"We study the solar capture rate of inelastic dark matter with endothermic and/or exothermic interactions. By assuming that an inelastic dark matter signal will be observed in next generation direct detection experiments we can set a lower bound on the capture rate that is independent of the local dark matter density, the velocity distribution, the galactic escape velocity as well as the scattering cross section. In combination with upper limits from neutrino observatories we can place upper bounds on the annihilation channels leading to neutrinos. We find that, while endothermic scattering limits are weak in the isospin-conserving case, strong bounds may be set for exothermic interactions, in particular in the spin-dependent case. Furthermore, we study the implications of observing two direct detection signals, in which case one can halo-independently obtain the dark matter mass and the mass splitting, and disentangle the endothermic/exothermic nature of the scattering. Finally we discuss isospin violation. "
"We propose a lateral spin-blockade device that uses an InGaAs/InAlAs double quantum well (DQW), where the values of the Rashba spin-orbit parameter $\alpha_{\rm R}$ are opposite in sign but equal in magnitude between the constituent quantum wells (QW). By tuning the channel length of DQW and the magnitude of the externally applied in-plane magnetic field, one can block the transmission of one spin (e.g., spin-down) component, leading to a spin-polarized current. Such a spin-blocking effect, brought about by wave vector matching of the spin-split Fermi surfaces between the two QWs, paves the way for a new scheme of spin-polarized electric current generation for future spintronics applications based on semiconductor band engineering. "
Multiparton interactions modify the high energy hadronic cross section to produce minijets with a rapidity gap in the distribution of secondaries. At Tevatron energy the correction to the single scattering term is large for transverse momenta smaller than 6 GeV. 
"For $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the question of when $R(A) = \{a/a' : a, a' \in A\}$ is dense in the positive real numbers $\mathbb{R}_+$ has been examined by many authors over the years. In contrast, the $p$-adic setting is largely unexplored. We investigate conditions under which $R(A)$ is dense in the $p$-adic numbers. Techniques from elementary, algebraic, and analytic number theory are employed in this endeavor. We also pose many open questions that should be of general interest. "
In this Comment I point out some limitations of the proposal of Prezhdo and Brooksby for coupling quantum and classical degrees of freedom (Phys.Rev.Lett.86(2001)3215) if it is pushed too far. 
"Solar and atmospheric evidences have been established and can be explained by neutrino masses. Furthermore, other experiments claim a few unconfirmed neutrino anomalies. We critically reanalyze the 0nu2beta, LSND and NuTeV anomalies. "
"An inhomogeneous Tricomi equation is considered in a strip with a polynomial right-hand side. It is shown that the Dirichlet boundary value problem with polynomial boundary conditions has a polynomial solution. An algorithm for constructing this polynomial solution is given and examples are considered. If the strip lies in the ellipticity region of the equation, then this solution is unique in the class of functions of polynomial growth. If the strip lies in a mixed region, then the solution of the Dirichlet problem is not unique in the class of functions of polynomial growth, but it is unique in the class of polynomials. "
"The smallest integer t for which the Wilson loop W^{t} fails to exhibit area law is known as the confinement index of a given field theory. The confinement index provides us with subtle information on the vacuum properties of the system. We study the behavior of the Wilson and 't Hooft loops and compute the confinement index in a wide class of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. All possible electric and magnetic screenings are taken into account. The results found are consistent with the theta periodicity, and whenever such a check is available, with the factorization property of Seiberg-Witten curves. "
"In [1] we gave a precise holographic calculation of chaos at the scrambling time scale. We studied the influence of a small perturbation, long in the past, on a two-sided correlation function in the thermofield double state. A similar analysis applies to squared commutators and other out-of-time-order one-sided correlators [2-4]. The essential bulk physics is a high energy scattering problem near the horizon of an AdS black hole. The above papers used Einstein gravity to study this problem; in the present paper we consider stringy and Planckian corrections. Elastic stringy corrections play an important role, effectively weakening and smearing out the development of chaos. We discuss their signature in the boundary field theory, commenting on the extension to weak coupling. Inelastic effects, although important for the evolution of the state, leave a parametrically small imprint on the correlators that we study. We briefly discuss ways to diagnose these small corrections, and we propose another correlator where inelastic effects are order one. "
"We performed a systematic search for stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) by looking for X-ray sources that were detected during the ROSAT All Sky Survey and faded by more than an order of magnitude over the next two decades according to XMM-Newton serendipitous observations. Besides a number of highly variable persistent X-ray sources (like active galactic nuclei and cataclysmic variables), we found three sources that are broadly consistent with the TDE scenario: 1RXS J114727.1+494302, 1RXS J130547.2+641252, and 1RXS J235424.5-102053. A TDE association is also acceptable for the fourth source, 1RXS J112312.7+012858, but an AGN origin cannot be ruled out either. This statistics implies a TDE rate of $ \sim 3\times 10^{-5} $ yr$ ^{-1} $ per galaxy in the Universe within $z\sim 0.18$, which is broadly consistent with the estimates of the TDE rate in the more local Universe obtained previously. "
"We calculate the structure of neutron star interiors comprising both the hadronic and the quark phases. For the hadronic sector we employ a microscopic equation of state involving nucleons and hyperons derived within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock many-body theory with realistic two-body and three-body forces. For the description of quark matter, we use several different models, e.g. the MIT bag, the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL), the Color Dielectric (CDM), the Field Correlator method (FCM), and one based on the Dyson-Schwinger model (DSM). We find that a two solar mass hybrid star is possible only if the nucleonic EOS is stiff enough. "
"In this paper, we study the design and the delay-exponent of anytime codes over a three terminal relay network. We propose a bilayer anytime code based on anytime spatially coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and investigate the anytime characteristics through density evolution analysis. By using mathematical induction technique, we find analytical expressions of the delay-exponent for the proposed code. Through comparison, we show that the analytical delay-exponent has a close match with the delay-exponent obtained from numerical results. "
"We show that the shortfall risk of binomial approximations of game (Israeli) options converges to the shortfall risk in the corresponding Black--Scholes market considering Lipschitz continuous path-dependent payoffs for both discrete- and continuous-time cases. These results are new also for usual American style options. The paper continues and extends the study of Kifer [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16 (2006) 984--1033] where estimates for binomial approximations of prices of game options were obtained. Our arguments rely, in particular, on strong invariance principle type approximations via the Skorokhod embedding, estimates from Kifer [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16 (2006) 984--1033] and the existence of optimal shortfall hedging in the discrete time established by Dolinsky and Kifer [Stochastics 79 (2007) 169--195]. "
"We demonstrate quantum information can be transferred between two distant participants without any physical particles travelling between them. The key procedure of the counterfactual scheme is to entangle two nonlocal qubits with each other without interaction, so the scheme can also be used to generate nonlocal entanglement counterfactually. We here illustrate the scheme by using flying photon qubits and stationary electron-spin qubits assisted by quantum dots inside double-sided optical microcavities. Unlike the typical teleportation, the present scheme does not require prior entanglement sharing or classical communication between the two distant participants. "
"We report new correlations between ratios of band intensities of the 15-20 {\mu}m emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a sample of fifty-seven sources observed with Spitzer/IRS. This sample includes Large Magellanic Cloud point sources from the SAGE-Spec survey, nearby galaxies from the SINGS survey, two Galactic ISM cirrus sources and the spectral maps of the Galactic reflection nebulae NGC 2023 and NGC 7023. We find that the 16.4, 17.4 and 17.8 {\mu}m band intensities are inter-correlated in all environments. In NGC 2023 and NGC 7023 these bands also correlate with the 11.0 and 12.7 {\mu}m band intensities. The 15.8 {\mu}m band correlates only with the 15-20 {\mu}m plateau and the 11.2 {\mu}m emission. We examine the spatial morphology of these bands and introduce radial cuts. We find that these bands can be spatially organized into three sets: the 12.7, 16.4 and 17.8 {\mu}m bands; the 11.2, 15.8 {\mu}m bands and the 15-18 {\mu}m plateau; and the 11.0 and 17.4 {\mu}m bands. We also find that the spatial distribution of the 12.7, 16.4 and 17.8 {\mu}m bands can be reconstructed by averaging the spatial distributions of the cationic 11.0 {\mu}m and neutral 11.2 {\mu}m bands. We conclude that the 17.4 {\mu}m band is dominated by cations, the 15.8 {\mu}m band by neutral species, and the 12.7, 16.4 and 17.8 {\mu}m bands by a combination of the two. These results highlight the importance of PAH ionization for spatially differentiating sub-populations by their 15-20 {\mu}m emission variability. "
"Service robots are complex, heterogeneous, software intensive systems built from components. Recent robotics research trends mainly address isolated capabilities on functional level. Non-functional properties, such as responsiveness or deterministic behavior, are addressed only in isolation (if at all). We argue that handling such non-functional properties on system level is a crucial next step. We claim that precise control over application-specific, dynamic execution and interaction behavior of functional components -- i.e. clear computation and communication semantics on model level without hidden code-defined parts -- is a key ingredient thereto. In this paper, we propose modeling concepts for these semantics, and present a meta-model which (i) enables component developers to implement component functionalities without presuming application-specific, system-level attributes, and (ii) enables system integrators to reason about causal dependencies between components as well as system-level data-flow characteristics. This allows to control data-propagation semantics and system properties such as end-to-end latencies during system integration without breaking component encapsulation. "
We study the singular limit of a spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic reaction-diffusion equation. We use a Finsler metric related to the anisotropic diffusion term and work in relative geometry. We prove a weak comparison principle and perform an analysis of both the generation and the motion of interfaces. The limit problem involves motion by anisotropic mean curvature. We also prove an optimal estimate of the thickness of the transition layer. 
"The effect of threshold singularities induced by unstable particles on two-loop observables is investigated and it is shown how to cure them working in the complex-mass scheme. The impact on radiative corrections around thresholds is thoroughly analyzed and shown to be relevant for two selected LHC and ILC applications: Higgs production via gluon fusion and decay into two photons at two loops in the Standard Model. Concerning Higgs production, it is essential to understand possible sources of large corrections in addition to the well-known QCD effects. It is shown that NLO electroweak corrections can incongruently reach a 10 % level around the WW vector-boson threshold without a complete implementation of the complex-mass scheme in the two-loop calculation. "
"Concept drift is formally defined as the change in joint distribution of a set of input variables X and a target variable y. The two types of drift that are extensively studied are real drift and virtual drift where the former is the change in posterior probabilities p(y|X) while the latter is the change in distribution of X without affecting the posterior probabilities. Many approaches on concept drift detection either assume full availability of data labels, y or handle only the virtual drift. In a streaming environment, the assumption of full availability of data labels, y is questioned. On the other hand, approaches that deal with virtual drift failed to address real drift. Rather than improving the state-of-the-art methods, this paper presents a semi-supervised framework to deal with the challenges above. The objective of the proposed framework is to learn from streaming environment with limited data labels, y and detect real drift concurrently. This paper proposes a novel concept drift detection method utilizing the densities of posterior probabilities in partially labeled streaming environments. Experimental results on both synthetic and realworld datasets show that our proposed semi-supervised framework enables the detection of concept drift in such environment while achieving comparable prediction performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

"With the advances in high resolution and spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy as well as atomic-scale manipulation, it has become possible to create and characterize quantum states of matter bottom-up, atom-by-atom. This is largely based on controlling the particle- or wave-like nature of electrons, as well as the interactions between spins, electrons, and orbitals and their interplay with structure and dimensionality. We review the recent advances in creating artificial electronic and spin lattices that lead to various exotic quantum phases of matter, ranging from topological Dirac dispersion to complex magnetic order. We also project future perspectives in non-equilibrium dynamics, prototype technologies, engineered quantum phase transitions and topology, as well as the evolution of complexity from simplicity in this newly developing field. "
"This paper studies the projected saddle-point dynamics associated to a convex-concave function, which we term saddle function. The dynamics consists of gradient descent of the saddle function in variables corresponding to convexity and (projected) gradient ascent in variables corresponding to concavity. We examine the role that the local and/or global nature of the convexity-concavity properties of the saddle function plays in guaranteeing convergence and robustness of the dynamics. Under the assumption that the saddle function is twice continuously differentiable, we provide a novel characterization of the omega-limit set of the trajectories of this dynamics in terms of the diagonal blocks of the Hessian. Using this characterization, we establish global asymptotic convergence of the dynamics under local strong convexity-concavity of the saddle function. When strong convexity-concavity holds globally, we establish three results. First, we identify a Lyapunov function (that decreases strictly along the trajectory) for the projected saddle-point dynamics when the saddle function corresponds to the Lagrangian of a general constrained convex optimization problem. Second, for the particular case when the saddle function is the Lagrangian of an equality-constrained optimization problem, we show input-to-state stability of the saddle-point dynamics by providing an ISS Lyapunov function. Third, we use the latter result to design an opportunistic state-triggered implementation of the dynamics. Various examples illustrate our results. "
"We study macroevolutionary dynamics by extending microevolutionary competition models to long time scales. It has been shown that for a general class of competition models, gradual evolutionary change in continuous phenotypes (evolutionary dynamics) can be non-stationary and even chaotic when the dimension of the phenotype space in which the evolutionary dynamics unfold is high. It has also been shown that evolutionary diversification can occur along non-equilibrium trajectories in phenotype space. We combine these lines of thinking by studying long-term coevolutionary dynamics of emerging lineages in multi-dimensional phenotype spaces. We use a statistical approach to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of many different systems. We find: 1) for a given dimension of phenotype space, the coevolutionary dynamics tends to be fast and non-stationary for an intermediate number of coexisting lineages, but tends to stabilize as the evolving communities reach a saturation level of diversity; and 2) the amount of diversity at the saturation level increases rapidly (exponentially) with the dimension of phenotype space. These results have implications for theoretical perspectives on major macroevolutionary patterns such as adaptive radiation, long-term temporal patterns of phenotypic changes, and the evolution of diversity.

"Motivated by the new Laplace transforms for the Kummer's confluent hypergeometric functions $_1F_1$ obtained recently by Kim et al. [Math $\&$ Comput. Modelling, 55 (2012), pp. 1068--1071], the authors aim is to establish so far unknown Laplace transforms of rather general case of generalized hypergeometric functions $_2F_2(x)$ and $_3F_3(x)$ by employing extensions of classical summation theorems for the series $_2F_1$ and $_3F_2$ obtained recently by Kim et al. [Int. J. Math. Math. Sci., 309503, 26 pages, 2010]. Certain known results obtained earlier by Kim et al. follow cases of our main findings. "
"The absolute visual magnitude as function of the observed colour (B-V), also named Hertzsprung-Russell diagram can be described through five equations; that in presence of calibrated stars means eight constants. The developed framework allows to deduce the remaining physical parameters that are mass, radius and luminosity. This new technique is applied to the first 10 pc, the first 50 pc, the Hyades and to the determination of the distance of a cluster. The case of the white dwarfs is analysed assuming the absence of calibrated data: our equation produces a smaller $\chi^2$ in respect to the standard colour-magnitude calibration when applied to the Villanova Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs. The theoretical basis of the formulae for the colours and the bolometric correction of the stars are clarified through a Taylor expansion in the temperature of the Planck distribution. "
"We study the classical problem of prediction with expert advice in the adversarial setting with a geometric stopping time. In 1965, Cover gave the optimal algorithm for the case of 2 experts. In this paper, we design the optimal algorithm, adversary and regret for the case of 3 experts. Further, we show that the optimal algorithm for $2$ and $3$ experts is a probability matching algorithm (analogous to Thompson sampling) against a particular randomized adversary. Remarkably, our proof shows that the probability matching algorithm is not only optimal against this particular randomized adversary, but also minimax optimal. Our analysis develops upper and lower bounds simultaneously, analogous to the primal-dual method. Our analysis of the optimal adversary goes through delicate asymptotics of the random walk of a particle between multiple walls. We use the connection we develop to random walks to derive an improved algorithm and regret bound for the case of $4$ experts, and, provide a general framework for designing the optimal algorithm and adversary for an arbitrary number of experts. "
"Chase-escape is a competitive growth process in which red particles spread to adjacent uncolored sites while blue particles overtake adjacent red particles. This can be thought of as prey escaping from pursuing predators. On d-ary trees, we introduce the modification that red particles die and describe the phase diagram for red and blue particle survival as the death rate is varied. Our analysis includes the behavior at criticality, which is different than what occurs in the process without death. Many of our results rely on novel connections to weighted Catalan numbers and analytic combinatorics. "
"In this paper we outline the computation of the partition function for the generalized Kodama states (GKod) of quantum gravity using the background field method. We show that the coupling constant for GKod is the same dimensionless coupling constant that appears in the partition function of the pure Kodama state (Chern--Simons functional) and argue that the GKod partition function is renormalizable as a loop expansion in direct analogy to Chern--Simons perturbation theory. The GKod partition function contains an infinite set of 1PI vertices uniquely fixed, as a result of the semiclassical-quantum correspondence, by the first-order vertex. This implies the existence of a well-defined effective action for the partition function since the `phase' of the GKod, provided a finite state exists, is equivalent to this effective action. Additionally, the separation of the matter from the gravitational contributions bears a resemblance to the infinite dimensional analogue to Kaluza--Klein theory. Future directions of research include extension of the computations of this paper to the norm of the GKod as well as to examine the analogue of the Chern--Simons Jone's polynomials and link invariants using the GKod as a measure. "
"The paper presents some distributional properties of logistic order statistics subject to independent exponential one-sided and two-sided shifts. Utilizing these properties, we extend several known results and obtain some new characterizations of the logistic distribution. "
"We study the correlation and response dynamics of trap models of glassy dynamics, considering observables that only partially decorrelate with every jump. This is inspired by recent work on a microscopic realization of such models, which found strikingly simple linear out-of-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations in the limit of slow decorrelation. For the Barrat-Mezard model with its entropic barriers we obtain exact results at zero temperature $T$ for arbitrary decorrelation factor $\kappa$. These are then extended to nonzero $T$, where the qualitative scaling behaviour and all scaling exponents can still be found analytically. Unexpectedly, the choice of transition rates (Glauber versus Metropolis) affects not just prefactors but also some exponents. In the limit of slow decorrelation even complete scaling functions are accessible in closed form. The results show that slowly decorrelating observables detect persistently slow out-of-equilibrium dynamics, as opposed to intermittent behaviour punctuated by excursions into fast, effectively equilibrated states. "
"We consider an oblique incidence on a uniform dielectric layer of the plane monochromatic TE- and TM-waves, as well as TE- and TM-polarized wave packets consisting of waves with the same angle of incidence. For each polarization the stationary model is presented, which allows one to uniquely restore the dynamics of the transmitted and reflected components of the incident wave packet at all stages of scattering. On this basis we introduce the concepts of ``true group-delay time""\/ and ``false group-delay time""\/ (the corresponding quantities for transmission and reflection are the same). The former is defined as the difference of two instants in the evolution of the same wave packet, one of which cannot be measured directly. Conversely, the latter is defined as the difference of two instants in the evolution of different wave packets, both can be measured directly. The false group-delay time does not in itself have a physical sense, but plays a key role for an indirect measurement of the true group-delay times of both polarizations. "
"Modern architectures require applications to make effective use of caches to achieve high performance and hide memory latency. This in turn requires careful consideration of placement of data in memory to exploit spatial locality, leverage hardware prefetching and conserve memory bandwidth. In unmanaged languages like C++, memory optimisations are common, but at the cost of losing object abstraction and memory safety. In managed languages like Java and C#, the abstract view of memory and proliferation of moving compacting garbage collection does not provide enough control over placement and layout. We have proposed SHAPES, a type-driven abstract placement specification that can be integrated with object-oriented languages to enable memory optimisations. SHAPES preserves both memory and object abstraction. In this paper, we formally specify the SHAPES semantics and describe its memory safety model. "
"In this article, we consider mild solutions to a class of impulsive fractional evolution equations of order $0<\alpha<1$. After analyzing analytic results reported in the literature using Mittag-Leffer function, $\alpha$-resolvent operator theory, we propose a more appropriate new definition of mild solutions for impulsive fractional evolution equations by replacing the impulse term operator $S_\alpha(t-t_i)$ with $S_\alpha(t)S_\alpha^{-1}(t_i)$, where $S_\alpha^{-1}(t_i)$ denotes the inverse of the fractional solution operator $S_\alpha(t)$ at $t=t_i, (i=1,2,\cdots m)$. "
"We propose the idea that time evolution of quantum systems is driven by work. The formalism presented here falls within the scope of a recently proposed theory of gravitating quantum matter where extractible work, and not energy, is responsible for gravitation. Our main assumption is that extractible work, and not the Hamiltonian, dictates dynamics. We find that expectation values of meaningful quantities, such as the occupation number, deviate from those predicted by standard quantum mechanics. The scope, applications and validity of this proposal are also discussed. "
"We study the problem of learning choice functions, which play an important role in various domains of application, most notably in the field of economics. Formally, a choice function is a mapping from sets to sets: Given a set of choice alternatives as input, a choice function identifies a subset of most preferred elements. Learning choice functions from suitable training data comes with a number of challenges. For example, the sets provided as input and the subsets produced as output can be of any size. Moreover, since the order in which alternatives are presented is irrelevant, a choice function should be symmetric. Perhaps most importantly, choice functions are naturally context-dependent, in the sense that the preference in favor of an alternative may depend on what other options are available. We formalize the problem of learning choice functions and present two general approaches based on two representations of context-dependent utility functions. Both approaches are instantiated by means of appropriate neural network architectures, and their performance is demonstrated on suitable benchmark tasks. "
"The purposes of this work are to construct a class of homogeneous vertex representations of $C_l^{(1)} \ (l\geq2)$, and to derive a series of product-sum identities. These identities have fine interpretation in number theory. "
"We report an approach for determination of zero-field splitting parameters from four-component relativistic calculations. Our approach involves neither perturbative treatment of spin-orbit interaction nor truncation of the spin-orbit coupled states. We make use of a multi-state implementation of relativistic complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT2), partially contracted N-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2), and multi-reference configuration interaction theory (MRCI), all with the fully internally contracted ansatz. A mapping is performed from the Dirac Hamiltonian to the pseudospin Hamiltonian, using correlated energies and the magnetic moment matrix elements of the reference wavefunctions. Direct spin-spin coupling is naturally included through the full 2-electron Breit interaction. Benchmark calculations on chalcogen diatomics and pseudotetrahedral cobalt(II) complexes show accuracy comparable to the commonly used state-interaction with spin-orbit (SI-SO) approach, while tests on a uranium(III) single-ion magnet suggest that for actinide complexes the strengths of our approach through the more robust treatment of spin-orbit effects and the avoidence of state truncation are of greater importance. "
"The deep inelastic scattering 2+1 jet cross- section is a useful observable for precision tests of QCD, e.g. measuring the strong coupling constant alpha(s). A consistent analysis requires a good understanding of the theoretical uncertainties and one of the most fundamental ones in QCD is due to the renormalization scheme and scale ambiguity. Different methods, which have been proposed to resolve the scale ambiguity, are applied to the 2+1 jet cross-section and the uncertainty is estimated. It is shown that the uncertainty can be made smaller by choosing the jet definition in a suitable way. "
"On the basis of perturbation theory in fine structure constant alpha and the ratio of electron to muon masses we calculate one-loop vacuum polarization, electron vertex corrections, nuclear structure and recoil corrections to hyperfine splitting of the ground state in muonic lithium ions $(\mu\ e\ ^6_3Li)^+$ and $(\mu\ e\ ^7_3Li)^+$. We obtain total results for the ground state small hyperfine splittings in $(\mu\ e\ ^6_3Li)^+$ $\Delta\nu_1=21572.16$ MHz and $\Delta\nu_2=14152.56$ MHz and in $(\mu\ e\ ^7_3Li)^+$ $\Delta\nu_1=21733.06$ MHz and $\Delta\nu_2=13994.35$ MHz which can be considered as a reliable estimate for a comparison with future experimental data. "
"A new efficient algorithm is proposed for factoring polynomials over an algebraic extension field. The extension field is defined by a polynomial ring modulo a maximal ideal. If the maximal ideal is given by its Groebner basis, no extra Groebner basis computation is needed for factoring a polynomial over this extension field. Nothing more than linear algebraic technique is used to get a polynomial over the ground field by a generic linear map. Then this polynomial is factorized over the ground field. From these factors, the factorization of the polynomial over the extension field is obtained. The new algorithm has been implemented and computer experiments indicate that the new algorithm is very efficient, particularly in complicated examples. "
"We perform a stability analysis of a tidally excited nonlinear internal gravity wave near the centre of a solar-type star in two-dimensions. The motivation is to understand the tidal interaction between short-period planets and their solar-type host stars, which involves the launching of gravity waves at the top of the radiation zone that propagate towards the stellar centre. Studying the instabilities of these waves near the centre, where nonlinearities are most important, is essential, since it may have implications for the survival of these planets. When the waves have sufficient amplitude to overturn the stratification, they break and form a critical layer, which efficiently absorbs subsequent ingoing wave angular momentum, and can result in the planet spiralling into the star. However, previous simulations do not find the waves to undergo instability for smaller amplitudes. This work has two aims: to determine any instabilities that set in for small-amplitude waves, and to further understand the breaking of large-amplitude waves. Our main result is that the waves undergo parametric instabilities for any amplitude. However, because the nonlinearity is spatially localised in the innermost wavelengths, their growth rates are sufficiently small that they do not result in astrophysically important tidal dissipation. The resulting modified tidal quality factors are estimated to be Q'_star>10^7, and possibly much greater, so the dissipation is much weaker than that which results from critical-layer absorption. These results support our explanation for the survival of all currently observed short-period planets around solar-type main-sequence stars: that planets unable to cause wave breaking at the centre of their host stars are likely to survive against tidal decay. This hypothesis will be tested by ongoing and future observations of transiting planets, such as WASP and Kepler. "
"The Institute for Science Information (ISI) has generated two lists of citation information for astronomers that are uniquely restricted both as to the years surveyed for the cited papers, and the years surveyed for the citing papers. The main list gives citation data for 62,813 physicists and astronomers whose journal papers were cited 100 times or more from 1981.0 to 1997.5 by papers published during the same time interval. The second list gives the 200 most-cited papers/year published in refereed astronomical journals from 1981-1996, as cited in papers in those same journals from 1981.0-1998.0. Astronomer names were selected from various sources. From this work an Astronomy Citation Database (ACD) has been constructed, containing citation data for 6458+ astronomers, plus additional data for 173 astronomers and the top-10 cited papers published 1981-1996. Various problems, both substantial and subtle, of producing a reasonably fair citation database are detailed. Chief among these are whether to assign either parital or full credit for each author on a given paper. Whether one is honored with one of the top astronomy lifetime-awards is a strong function of how well your work stands out as your own, and in what kind of publications you publish (e.g., the ISI does not keep track of papers in meeting proceedings/books/catalogs). Name confusion affects this kind of analysis to the extent that that it would take an enormous effort to disentangle its effects and, even then, not all name confusion would be settled. A ``modest proposal'' is made that our professional field (and others) go to a system of uniquely associating an identification number to each author on each paper to solve the name confusion problem.

"We present a hundred-watt-level linearly-polarized random fiber laser (RFL) pumped by incoherent broadband amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source and prospect the power scaling potential theoretically. The RFL employs half-opened cavity structure which is composed by a section of 330 m polarization maintained (PM) passive fiber and two PM high reflectivity fiber Bragg gratings. The 2nd order Stokes light centered at 1178 nm reaches the pump limited maximal power of 100.7 W with a full width at half-maximum linewidth of 2.58 nm and polarization extinction ratio of 23.5 dB. The corresponding ultimate quantum efficiency of pump to 2nd order Stokes light is 89.01%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of linearly-polarized high-order RFL with hundred-watt output power. Furthermore, the theoretical investigation indicates that 300 W-level linearly-polarized single-mode 1st order Stokes light can be obtained from incoherently pumped RFL with 100 m PM passive fiber. "
"Scene Parsing is a crucial step to enable autonomous systems to understand and interact with their surroundings. Supervised deep learning methods have made great progress in solving scene parsing problems, however, come at the cost of laborious manual pixel-level annotation. To alleviate this effort synthetic data as well as weak supervision have both been investigated. Nonetheless, synthetically generated data still suffers from severe domain shift while weak labels are often imprecise. Moreover, most existing works for weakly supervised scene parsing are limited to salient foreground objects. The aim of this work is hence twofold: Exploit synthetic data where feasible and integrate weak supervision where necessary. More concretely, we address this goal by utilizing depth as transfer domain because its synthetic-to-real discrepancy is much lower than for color. At the same time, we perform weak localization from easily obtainable image level labels and integrate both using a novel contour-based scheme. Our approach is implemented as a teacher-student learning framework to solve the transfer learning problem by generating a pseudo ground truth. Using only depth-based adaptation, this approach already outperforms previous transfer learning approaches on the popular indoor scene parsing SUN RGB-D dataset. Our proposed two-stage integration more than halves the gap towards fully supervised methods when compared to previous state-of-the-art in transfer learning. "
"Identity management systems (IDMSs) are widely used to provision user identities while managing authentication, authorization, and data sharing both within organizations as well as on the Internet more broadly. Traditional identity systems typically suffer from single points of failure, lack of interoperability, and privacy issues such as encouraging mass data collection and user tracking. Blockchain technology has the potential to support novel data ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms, which may benefit both users and businesses by alleviating these concerns; as a result, blockchain-based IDMSs are beginning to proliferate. This work categorizes these systems into a taxonomy based on differences in architecture, governance models, and other salient features. We provide context for the taxonomy by describing related terms, emerging standards, and use cases, while highlighting relevant security and privacy considerations. "
"The spectroscopy of free radicals and radical containing entrance-channel complexes embedded in superfluid helium nano-droplets is reviewed. The collection of dopants inside individual droplets in the beam represents a micro-canonical ensemble, and as such each droplet may be considered an isolated cryo-reactor. The unique properties of the droplets, namely their low temperature (0.4 K) and fast cooling rates ($\sim10^{16}$ K s$^{-1}$) provides novel opportunities for the formation and high-resolution studies of molecular complexes containing one or more free radicals. The production methods of radicals are discussed in light of their applicability for embedding the radicals in helium droplets. The spectroscopic studies performed to date on molecular radicals and on entrance / exit-channel complexes of radicals with stable molecules are detailed. The observed complexes provide new information on the potential energy surfaces of several fundamental chemical reactions and on the intermolecular interactions present in open-shell systems. Prospects of further experiments of radicals embedded in helium droplets are discussed, especially the possibilities to prepare and study high-energy structures and their controlled manipulation, as well as the possibility of fundamental physics experiments.

"The first law for the holographic entanglement entropy of spheres in a boundary CFT with a bulk Lovelock dual is extended to include variations of the bulk Lovelock coupling constants. Such variations in the bulk correspond to perturbations within a family of boundary CFTs. The new contribution to the first law is found to be the product of the variation $\delta a$ of the A-type trace anomaly coefficient for even dimensional CFTs, or more generally its extension $\delta a^*$ to include odd dimensional boundaries, times the ratio $S/a^*$. Since $a^*$ is a measure of the number of degrees of freedom $N$ per unit volume of the boundary CFT, this new term has the form $\mu\delta N$, where the chemical potential $\mu$ is given by the entanglement entropy per degree of freedom. "
"We use the field theoretical model to perform relativistic calculations of neutrino energy losses caused by the direct Urca processes on nucleons in the degenerate baryon matter. By our analysis, the direct neutron decay in the superdense nuclear matter under beta equilibrium is open only due to the isovector meson fields, which create a large energy gap between protons and neutrons in the medium. Our expression for the neutrino energy losses, obtained in the mean field approximation, incorporates the effects of nucleon recoil, parity violation, weak magnetism, and pseudoscalar interaction. For numerical testing of our formula, we use a self-consistent relativistic model of the multicomponent baryon matter. The relativistic emissivity of the direct Urca reactions is found substantially larger than predicted in the non-relativistic approach. We found that, due to weak magnetism effects, relativistic emissivities increase by approximately 40-50%, while the pseudoscalar interaction only slightly suppresses the energy losses, approximately by 5%. "
"Extreme black holes have been argued to be unstable, in the sense that under linearized gravitational perturbations of the extreme Kerr spacetime the Weyl scalar $\psi_4$ blows up along their event horizons at very late advanced times. We show numerically, by solving the Teukolsky equation in 2+1D, that all algebraically-independent curvature scalar polynomials approach limits that exist when advanced time along the event horizon approaches infinity. Therefore, the horizons of extreme black holes are stable against linearized gravitational perturbations. We argue that the divergence of $\psi_4$ is a consequence of the choice of a fixed tetrad, and that in a suitable dynamical tetrad all Weyl scalars, including $\psi_4$, approach their background extreme Kerr values. We make similar conclusions also for the case of scalar field perturbations of extreme Kerr. "
"Andreev's Problem states the following: Given an integer $d$ and a subset of $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q$, is there a polynomial $y = p(x)$ of degree at most $d$ such that for every $a \in \mathbb{F}_q$, $(a,p(a)) \in S$? We show an $\text{AC}^0[\oplus]$ lower bound for this problem. This problem appears to be similar to the list recovery problem for degree $d$-Reed-Solomon codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ which states the following: Given subsets $A_1,\ldots,A_q$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$, output all (if any) the Reed-Solomon codewords contained in $A_1\times \cdots \times A_q$. For our purpose, we study this problem when $A_1, \ldots, A_q$ are random subsets of a given size, which may be of independent interest. "
"Water gas shift (WGS) reaction is a chemical reaction in which carbon monoxide reacts with water vapor to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. It is an important reaction industrially used in conjunction with steam reforming of hydrocarbons for the production of high purity hydrogen. Grenoble et al examined the roles of both active metals and metal oxide support on the kinetics of the WGS reaction. They found out that the turn over numbers of various Al2O3 supported transition metals decreased in the trend of Cu, Re, Co, Ru, Ni, Pt, Os, Au, Fe, Pd, Rh, and Ir, which corresponds nicely to the observed volcano shaped correlation between catalytic activities and respective CO adsorption heat. This is a strong indication that CO gets activated on the metal surface during the reaction and different metals have different activation energies. The authors also observed that the turn over number of Pt/Al2O3 was one order of magnitude higher than that of Pt/SiO2, indicating a strong support effect, which the authors ascribed to the activation of H2O.

"We study the long-wavelength collective modes in the magnetic-field-induced spin-density-wave (FISDW) phases experimentally observed in organic conductors of the Bechgaard salts family, focusing on phases that exhibit a sign reversal of the quantum Hall effect (Ribault anomaly). We have recently proposed that two SDW's coexist in the Ribault phase, as a result of Umklapp processes. When the latter are strong enough, the two SDW's become circularly polarized (helicoidal SDW's). In this paper, we study the collective modes which result from the presence of two SDW's. We find two Goldstone modes, an out-of-phase sliding mode and an in-phase spin-wave mode, and two gapped modes. The sliding Goldstone mode carries only a fraction of the total optical spectral weight, which is determined by the ratio of the amplitude of the two SDW's. In the helicoidal phase, all the spectral weight is pushed up above the SDW gap. We also point out similarities with phase modes in two-band or bilayer superconductors. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic two-SDW systems. "
"Assuming that AXPs and SGRs accrete matter from a fallback disk, we attempt to explain both the soft and the hard X-ray emission as the result of the accretion process. We also attempt to explain their radio emission or the lack of it. We test the hypothesis that the power-law, hard X-ray spectra are produced in the accretion flow mainly by bulk-motion Comptonization of soft photons emitted at the neutron star surface. Fallback disk models invoke surface dipole magnetic fields of $10^{12} - 10^{13}$ G, which is what we assume here. Unlike normal X-ray pulsars, for which the accretion rate is highly super-Eddington, the accretion rate is approximately Eddington in AXPs and SGRs and thus the bulk-motion Comptonization operates efficiently. As an illustrative example we reproduce both the hard and the soft X-ray spectra of AXP 4U 0142+61 well using the XSPEC package compTB. Our model seems to explain both the hard and the soft X-ray spectra of AXPs and SGRs, as well as their radio emission or the lack of it, in a natural way. It might also explain the short bursts observed in these sources. On the other hand, it cannot explain the giant X-ray outbursts observed in SGRs, which may result from the conversion of magnetic energy in local multipole fields. "
"This paper is devoted to the problem of prescribing the scalar curvature under zero boundary conditions. Using dynamical and topological methods involving the study of critical points at infinity of the associated variational problem, we prove some existence results on the standard half sphere. "
"Context: In a series of papers, we study the major merger of two disk galaxies in order to establish whether or not such a merger can produce a disc galaxy. Aims: Our aim here is to describe in detail the technical aspects of our numerical experiments. Methods: We discuss the initial conditions of our major merger, which consist of two protogalaxies on a collision orbit. We show that such merger simulations can produce a non-realistic central mass concentration, and we propose simple, parametric, AGN-like feedback as a solution to this problem. Our AGN-like feedback algorithm is very simple: at each time-step we take all particles whose local volume density is above a given threshold value and increase their temperature to a preset value. We also compare the GADGET3 and GIZMO codes, by applying both of them to the same initial conditions. Results: We show that the evolution of isolated protogalaxies resembles the evolution of disk galaxies, thus arguing that our protogalaxies are well suited for our merger simulations. We demonstrate that the problem with the unphysical central mass concentration in our merger simulations is further aggravated when we increase the resolution. We show that our AGN-like feedback removes this non-physical central mass concentration, and thus allows the formation of realistic bars. Note that our AGN-like feedback mainly affects the central region of a model, without significantly modifying the rest of the galaxy. We demonstrate that, in the context of our kind of simulation, GADGET3 gives results which are very similar to those obtained with the PSPH (density independent SPH) flavor of GIZMO. Moreover, in the examples we tried, the differences between the results of the two flavors of GIZMO, namely PSPH, and MFM (mesh-less algorithm) are similar to and, in some comparisons, larger than the differences between the results of GADGET3 and PSPH.

"Today's wireless networks are increasingly crowded with an explosion of wireless users, who have greater and more diverse quality of service (QoS) demands than ever before. However, the amount of spectrum that can be used to satisfy these demands remains finite. This leads to a great challenge for wireless users to effectively share the spectrum to achieve their QoS requirements. This paper presents a game theoretic model for spectrum sharing, where users seek to satisfy their QoS demands in a distributed fashion. Our spectrum sharing model is quite general, because we allow different wireless channels to provide different QoS, depending upon their channel conditions and how many users are trying to access them. Also, users can be highly heterogeneous, with different QoS demands, depending upon their activities, hardware capabilities, and technology choices. Under such a general setting, we show that it is NP hard to find a spectrum allocation which satisfies the maximum number of users' QoS requirements in a centralized fashion. We also show that allowing users to self-organize through distributed channel selections is a viable alternative to the centralized optimization, because better response updating is guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibria in polynomial time. By bounding the price of anarchy, we demonstrate that the worst case pure Nash equilibrium can be close to optimal, when users and channels are not very heterogenous. We also extend our model by considering the frequency spatial reuse, and consider the user interactions as a game upon a graph where players only contend with their neighbors. We prove that better response updating is still guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibrium in this more general spatial QoS satisfaction game. "
"High quality, thin diamond membranes containing nitrogen-vacancy centers provide critical advantages in the fabrication of diamond-based structures for a variety of applications, including wide field magnetometry, photonics and bio-sensing. In this work we describe, in detail, the generation of thin, optically-active diamond membranes by means of ion implantation and overgrowth. To establish the suitability of our method for photonic applications, photonic crystal cavities with quality factor of 1000 are fabricated. "
"This paper is concerned with qualitative properties of solutions to nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations of the form$$ \int\_{\mathbb{R}^N\setminus K} J(x-y)\,\big( u(y)-u(x) \big)\,\D y+f(u(x))=0, \quad x\in\R^N\setminus K,$$set in a perforated open set $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus K$, where $K\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded compact ""obstacle"" and $f$ is a bistable nonlinearity. When $K$ is convex, we prove some Liouville-type results for solutions satisfying some asymptotic limiting conditions at infinity. We also establish a robustness result, assuming slightly relaxed conditions on $K$. "
"The OPERA experiment has conclusively observed the appearance of tau neutrinos in the muon neutrino CNGS beam. Exploiting the OPERA detector capabilities, it was possible to isolate high purity samples of $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ charged current weak neutrino interactions, as well as neutral current weak interactions. In this Letter, the full dataset is used for the first time to test the three-flavor neutrino oscillation model and to derive constraints on the existence of a light sterile neutrino within the framework of the $3+1$ neutrino model. For the first time, tau and electron neutrino appearance channels are jointly used to test the sterile neutrino hypothesis. A significant fraction of the sterile neutrino parameter space allowed by LSND and MiniBooNE experiments is excluded at 90% C.L. In particular, the best-fit values obtained by MiniBooNE combining neutrino and antineutrino data are excluded at 3.3 $\sigma$ significance. "
"Sensitive searches for antineutrino oscillations in atmospheric mass parameter region much discussed in recent years are based on accurate comparison of the inverse beta decay positron spectra measured in two (or more) detectors, far and near, stationed e.g. at ~1000 m and ~100 m from the reactor(s). We show that antineutrinos emitted from the stored irradiated fuel can differently distort the soft part of positron spectra measured in the far and near detector and thus mimic (or hide) the oscillation signal "
This book is devoted to the spectral analysis of the magnetic Laplacian in various geometric situations. In particular the influence of the geometry on the discrete spectrum is analysed in many asymptotic regimes. 
"The trace of the heat kernel in a (D+1)-dimensional Euclidean spacetime (integer D > 1) is used to derive the free energy in finite temperature field theory. The spacetime presents a D-dimensional compact space (domain) with a (D-1)-dimensional boundary, and a closed dimension, whose volume is proportional the Planck's inverse temperature. The thermal sum appears due to topology of the closed Euclidean time. The obtained free energy in (3+1) and (2+1) dimensions contain two contributions defined by the volume of a domain and by the volume of the domain's boundary. This functional is finite and valid for arbitrary values of the Planck's inverse temperature. The absolute zero of thermodynamic temperature is forbidden topologically, and no universal low temperature asymptotics of the free energy can exist. "
"Human motion capture data has been widely used in data-driven character animation. In order to generate realistic, natural-looking motions, most data-driven approaches require considerable efforts of pre-processing, including motion segmentation and annotation. Existing (semi-) automatic solutions either require hand-crafted features for motion segmentation or do not produce the semantic annotations required for motion synthesis and building large-scale motion databases. In addition, human labeled annotation data suffers from inter- and intra-labeler inconsistencies by design. We propose a semi-automatic framework for semantic segmentation of motion capture data based on supervised machine learning techniques. It first transforms a motion capture sequence into a ``motion image'' and applies a convolutional neural network for image segmentation. Dilated temporal convolutions enable the extraction of temporal information from a large receptive field. Our model outperforms two state-of-the-art models for action segmentation, as well as a popular network for sequence modeling. Most of all, our method is very robust under noisy and inaccurate training labels and thus can handle human errors during the labeling process. "
The results of a recent experiment measuring the reaction pp -> dK^+ \bar K^0 near threshold are interpreted in terms of a spectator model that encapsulates the main features of the observed K^+ \bar K^0 invariant mass distribution. A chi^2 fit to this data leads to an imaginary part of the isovector scattering length in the K \bar K channel of Im(a_1) = -(0.63 \pm 0.24) fm. We then use the Flatte representation of the scattering amplitude to infer a value Re(a_1) = -(0.02 \pm 0.02) fm for the real part under the assumption that scaling is approximately satisfied. We show further that it is not possible to exclude the effects of \pi^+\eta to K^+ \bar K^0 channel coupling within the context of our model. 
"We introduce a weaker variant of the concept of three point property, which is equivalent to a non-linear local connectivity condition introduced in [12], sufficient to guarantee the extendability of a conformal map f from the unit disk onto a domain to the entire plane as a homeomorphism of locally exponentially integrable distortion. Sufficient conditions for extendability to a homeomorphism of locally p-integrable distortion are also given. "
"Currently, we have only limited means to probe the presence of planets at large orbital separations. Foreman-Mackey et al. searched for long-period transiting planets in the Kepler light curves using an automated pipeline. Here, we apply their pipeline, with minor modifications, to a larger sample and use updated stellar parameters from Gaia DR2. The latter boosts the stellar radii for most of the planet candidates found by FM16, invalidating a number of them as false positives. We identify 15 candidates, including two new ones. All have sizes from 0.3 to 1 $R_{\rm J}$, and all but two have periods from 2 to 10 yr. We report two main findings based on this sample. First, the planet occurrence rate for the above size and period ranges is $0.70^{+0.40}_{-0.20}$ planets per Sun-like star, with the frequency of cold Jupiters agreeing with that from radial velocity surveys. Planet occurrence rises with decreasing planet size, roughly describable as $dN/d\log R \propto R^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = -1.6^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$, i.e., Neptune-sized planets are some four times more common than Jupiter-sized ones. Second, five out of our 15 candidates orbit stars with known transiting planets at shorter periods, including one with five inner planets. We interpret this high incidence rate to mean: (1) almost all our candidates should be genuine; (2) across a large orbital range (from $\sim 0.05$ to a few astronomical units), mutual inclinations in these systems are at most a few degrees; and (3) large outer planets exist almost exclusively in systems with small inner planets. "
"The trapezoidal rule, which is a special case of the Newmark family of algorithms, is one of the most widely used methods for transient hyperbolic problems. In this work, we show that this rule conserves linear and angular momenta and energy in the case of undamped linear elastodynamics problems, and an `energy-like measure' in the case of undamped acoustic problems. These conservation properties, thus, provide a rational basis for using this algorithm. In linear elastodynamics problems, variants of the trapezoidal rule that incorporate `high-frequency' dissipation are often used, since the higher frequencies, which are not approximated properly by the standard displacement-based approach, often result in unphysical behavior. Instead of modifying the trapezoidal algorithm, we propose using a hybrid finite element framework for constructing the stiffness matrix. Hybrid finite elements, which are based on a two-field variational formulation involving displacement and stresses, are known to approximate the eigenvalues much more accurately than the standard displacement-based approach, thereby either bypassing or reducing the need for high-frequency dissipation. We show this by means of several examples, where we compare the numerical solutions obtained using the displacement-based and hybrid approaches against analytical solutions. "
"We study the phenomenology of a keV sterile neutrino in a supersymmetric model with $U(1)_R-$ lepton number in the light of a very recent observation of an X-ray line signal at around 3.5 keV, detected in the X-ray spectra of Andromeda galaxy and various galaxy clusters including the Perseus galaxy cluster. This model not only provides a small tree level mass to one of the active neutrinos but also renders a suitable warm dark matter candidate in the form of a sterile neutrino with negligible active-sterile mixing. Light neutrino masses and mixing can be explained once one-loop radiative corrections are taken into account. The scalar sector of this model can accommodate a Higgs boson with a mass of $\sim$ 125 GeV. In this model gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and we also study the cosmological implications of this light gravitino with mass $\sim \mathcal O$(GeV). "

"There are several issues to do with dwarf galaxy predictions in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology that have suscitated much recent debate about the possible modification of the nature of dark matter as providing a solution. We explore a novel solution involving ultra-light axions that can potentially resolve the missing satellites problem, the cusp-core problem, and the `too big to fail' problem. We discuss approximations to non-linear structure formation in dark matter models containing a component of ultra-light axions across four orders of magnitude in mass, $10^{-24}\text{ eV}\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-20}\text{ eV}$, a range too heavy to be well constrained by linear cosmological probes such as the CMB and matter power spectrum, and too light/non-interacting for other astrophysical or terrestrial axion searches. We find that an axion of mass $m_a\approx 10^{-21}\text{ eV}$ contributing approximately $85\%$ of the total dark matter can introduce a significant kpc scale core in a typical Milky Way satellite galaxy in sharp contrast to a thermal relic with a transfer function cut off at the same scale, while still allowing such galaxies to form in significant number. Therefore ultra-light axions do not suffer from the \emph{Catch 22} that applies to using a warm dark matter as a solution to the small scale problems of cold dark matter. Our model simultaneously allows formation of enough high redshift galaxies to allow reconciliation with observational constraints, and also reduces the maximum circular velocities of massive dwarfs so that baryonic feedback may more plausibly resolve the predicted overproduction of massive MWG dwarf satellites. "
"We perform a comparative theoretical study of the data at spacelike momentum transfer for the $\gamma^*\gamma\to\pi^0$ transition form factor, just reported by the Belle Collaboration, vs. those published before by BaBar, also including the older CLEO and CELLO data. Various implications for the structure of the $\pi^0$ distribution amplitude vis-\`a-vis those data are discussed and the existing theoretical predictions are classified into three distinct categories. We argue that the actual bifurcation of the data with antithetic trends is artificial and reason that the Belle data are the better option. "
"We present a new study of the effects of quasar obscuration on the statistics of Damped Ly alpha (DLA) systems. We show that the extinction of any Galactic or extragalactic HI region increases with the column density of zinc with a turning point above which background sources are suddenly obscured. We derive a relation between the extinction of a DLA system and its HI column density, N, metallicity, Z, fraction of iron in dust, f_Fe(Z), and redshift, z. From this relation we estimate the fraction of DLA systems missed as a consequence of their own extinction in magnitude-limited surveys. We derive a method for recovering the true frequency distributions of N and Z in DLAs, f_N and f_Z, using the biased distributions measured in the redshift range where the observations have sufficient statistics (1.8 </= z </= 3). By applying our method we find that the well-known empirical thresholds of DLA column densities, N(ZnII) </~ 10^13.1 cm^-2 and N(HI) </~ 10^22 cm^-2 can be successfully explained in terms of the obscuration effect without tuning of the local dust parameters. The obscuration has a modest effect on the distribution of quasar apparent magnitudes, but plays an important role in shaping the statistical distributions of DLAs. The exact estimate of the bias is still limited by the paucity of the data (~40 zinc measurements at 1.8 </~ z </~ 3). We find that the fraction of DLAs missed as a consequence of obscuration is \~30% to 50%, consistent with the results of surveys of radio-selected quasars. By modelling the metallicity distribution with a Schechter function we find that the mean metallicity can be ~5 to 6 times higher than the value commonly reported for DLAs at z~2.3. "

"Talk is given at the YITP International Workshop -- `Recent Developments in QCD and Hadron Physics'. Recent CDF data of the inclusive jet cross section shows anomalous deviation around large transverse momentum $p_{T}(j)\approx 200 \sim 350$ GeV. Is it possible to interpret the anomaly in terms of virtual SUSY effects. The answer is `NO', because we find that the virtual SUSY loop interference effects are too small to explain the CDF data. "
"Spectroscopy of planetary nebulae (PNe) provides the means to investigate s-process enrichments of neutron(n)-capture elements that cannot be detected in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, accurate abundance determinations of these elements present a challenge. Corrections for unobserved ions can be large and uncertain, since in many PNe only one ion of a given n-capture element has been detected. Furthermore, the atomic data governing the ionization balance of these species are not well-determined, inhibiting the derivation of accurate ionization corrections. We present initial results of a program that addresses these challenges. Deep high resolution optical spectroscopy of ~20 PNe has been performed to detect emission lines from trans-iron species including Se, Br, Kr, Rb, and Xe. The optical spectral region provides access to multiple ions of these elements, which reduces the magnitude and importance of uncertainties in the ionization corrections. In addition, experimental and theoretical efforts are providing determinations of the photoionization cross-sections and recombination rate coefficients of Se, Kr, and Xe ions. These new atomic data will make it possible to derive robust ionization corrections for these elements. Together, our observational and atomic data results will enable n-capture element abundances to be determined with unprecedented accuracy in ionized nebulae. "
"We propose a nonparametric statistical test for goodness-of-fit: given a set of samples, the test determines how likely it is that these were generated from a target density function. The measure of goodness-of-fit is a divergence constructed via Stein's method using functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Our test statistic is based on an empirical estimate of this divergence, taking the form of a V-statistic in terms of the log gradients of the target density and the kernel. We derive a statistical test, both for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. samples, where we estimate the null distribution quantiles using a wild bootstrap procedure. We apply our test to quantifying convergence of approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, statistical model criticism, and evaluating quality of fit vs model complexity in nonparametric density estimation.

"Let $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)$ be the category of internal preorders in an exact category $\mathbb C$. We show that the pair $(\mathsf{Eq}(\mathbb C), \mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C))$ is a pretorsion theory in $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)$, where $\mathsf{Eq}(\mathbb C)$ and $\mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C)$) are the full subcategories of internal equivalence relations and of internal partial orders in $\mathbb C$, respectively. We observe that $\mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C)$ is a reflective subcategory of $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)$ such that each component of the unit of the adjunction is a pullback-stable regular epimorphism. The reflector $F:\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)\to \mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C)$ turns out to have stable units in the sense of Cassidy, H\'ebert and Kelly, thus inducing an admissible categorical Galois structure. In particular, when $\mathbb C$ is the category $\mathsf{Set}$ of sets, we show that this reflection induces a monotone-light factorization system (in the sense of Carboni, Janelidze, Kelly and Par\'e) in $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathsf{Set})$. A topological interpretation of our results in the category of Alexandroff-discrete spaces is also given, via the well-known isomorphism between this latter category and $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathsf{Set})$.

"An aperiodic and irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space converges to its stationary distribution. When convergence to equilibrium is measured by total variation distance, there exists an optimal coupling and a maximal coupling time. In this article, the maximal coupling time is compared to the hitting time of a specific state or set. Such sets, named halting sets, are studied in the case of symmetric birth-and-death chains and in some other examples. Some applications to the cutoff phenomenon are given. These results yield new methods to calculate cutoff times for some monotone birth-and death chains without the lazy hypothesis . "
"Rubble piles are a common feature of solar system bodies. They are composed of monolithic elements of ice or rock bound by gravity. Voids occupy a significant fraction of the volume of a rubble pile. They can exist up to pressure $P\approx \epsy\mu$, where $\epsy$ is the monolithic material's yield strain and $\mu$ its rigidity. At low $P$, contacts between neighboring elements are confined to a small fraction of their surface areas. As a result, the effective thermal conductivity of a rubble pile, $\kcon\approx k(P/(\epsy\mu))^{1/2}$, can be orders of magnitude smaller than, $k$, the thermal conductivity of its monolithic elements. In a fluid-free environment, only radiation can transfer energy across voids. It contributes an additional component, $\krad=16\ell\sigma T^3/3$, to the total effective conductivity, $\keff=\kcon +\krad$. Here $\ell$, the inverse of the opacity per unit volume, is of order the size of the elements and voids. An important distinction between $\kcon$ and $\krad$ is that the former is independent of the size of the elements whereas the latter is proportional to it. Our expression for $\keff$ provides a good fit to the depth dependence of thermal conductivity in the top $140\,\mathrm{cm}$ of the lunar regolith. It also offers a good starting point for detailed modeling of thermal inertias for asteroids and satellites. Measurement of the response of surface temperature to variable insolation is a valuable diagnostic of a regolith. There is an opportunity for careful experiments under controlled laboratory conditions to test models of thermal conductivity such as the one we outline. "
"Assuming that the actual values of the top quark mass at FNAL and of the ratio of partial widths Z->bb/Z->hadrons at LEP are within their current one-sigma reported ranges, we present a No-Lose Theorem for superpartner searches at LEP II and an upgraded Tevatron. We impose only two theoretical assumptions: the Lagrangian is that of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with arbitrary soft-breaking terms, and all couplings remain perturbative up to scales of order 10^16 GeV; there are no assumptions about the soft SUSY breaking parameters, proton decay, cosmology, etc. In particular, if the LEP and FNAL values hold up and supersymmetry is responsible for the discrepancy with the SM prediction of the partial width of Z->bb, then we must have charginos and/or top squarks observable at the upgraded machines. Furthermore, little deviation from the SM is predicted within ""super-unified"" SUSY. Finally, it appears to be extremely difficult to find any unified MSSM model, regardless of the form of soft SUSY breaking, that can explain the partial width for large tan(beta); in particular, no model with top-bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification appears to be consistent with the experiments.

"In our work on the development of model-independent data analysis methods for determining ratios between different couplings/cross sections of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) by using measured recoil energies from direct Dark Matter detection experiments directly, it was assumed that the analyzed data sets are background-free, i.e., all events are WIMP signals. In this article, as a more realistic study, we take into account a fraction of possible residue background events, which pass all discrimination criteria and then mix with other real WIMP-induced events in our data sets. Our simulations show that, assuming that the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-nucleus interaction dominates over the spin-independent (SI) one, the maximal acceptable fraction of residue background events in the analyzed data sets for determining the ratio of the SD WIMP coupling on neutrons to that on protons is ~ 20% - 40%; whereas considering a general combination of the SI and SD WIMP interactions, the maximal acceptable background ratio for determining the ratio between two SD WIMP couplings as well as the ratios of the SD cross section on protons (neutrons) to the SI one is ~ 10% - 20%. Moreover, by considering different forms of background spectrum, we find that only background events in the lowest energy ranges could affect the reconstructions (significantly); those in high energy ranges would almost not change the reconstructed ratios or only very slightly. "
"We present an FPGA-based online data reduction system for the pixel detector of the future Belle II experiment. The occupancy of the pixel detector is estimated at 3 %. This corresponds to a data output rate of more than 20 GB/s after zero suppression, dominated by background. The Online Selection Nodes (ONSEN) system aims to reduce the background data by a factor of 30. It consists of 33 MicroTCA cards, each equipped with a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA and 4 GiB DDR2 RAM. These cards are hosted by 9 AdvancedTCA carrier boards. The ONSEN system buffers the entire output data from the pixel detector for up to 5 seconds. During this time, the Belle II high-level trigger PC farm performs an online event reconstruction, using data from the other Belle II subdetectors. It extrapolates reconstructed tracks to the layers of the pixel detector and defines regions of interest around the intercepts. Based on this information, the ONSEN system discards all pixels not inside a region of interest before sending the remaining hits to the event builder system. During a beam test with one layer of the pixel detector and four layers of the surrounding silicon strip detector, including a scaled-down version of the high-level trigger and data acquisition system, the pixel data reduction using regions of interest was exercised. We investigated the data produced in more than 20 million events and verified that the ONSEN system behaved correctly, forwarding all pixels inside regions of interest and discarding the rest. "
We show that a direct limit of surjections of (weak) Golod--Shafarevich algebras is a weak Golod--Shafarevich algebra as well. This holds both for graded and for filtered algebras provided that the filtrations are induced by the filtration of the first entry of the sequence. It follows that the limit is an algebra of exponential growth. An example shows that the assumptions of this theorem cannot be directly weakened. 
"We report a Raman spectroscopy study of graphene field-effect transistors (GFET) with a controlled amount of defects introduced in graphene by exposure to electron-beam irradiation. Raman spectra are taken at T = 8 K over a range of back gate voltages (Vg) for various irradiation dosages (Re). We study effects in the Raman spectra due to Vg-induced doping and artificially created disorder at various Re. With moderate disorder (irradiation), the Raman G peak with respect to the graphene carrier density (nFE) exhibits a minimum in peak frequency and a maximum in peak width near the charge- neutral point (CNP). These trends are similar to those seen in previous works on pristine graphene and have been attributed to a reduction of electron-phonon coupling strength (D) and removal of the Kohn anomaly as the Fermi level moves away from the CNP. We also observe a maximum in I2D/IG and weak maximum in ID/IG near the CNP. All the observed dependences of Raman parameters on nFE weaken at stronger disorder (higher Re), implying that disorder causes a reduction of D as well. Our findings are valuable for understanding Raman spectra and electron-phonon physics in doped and disordered graphene. "
"In this paper, we study instances of complex neural networks, i.e. neural netwo rks with complex topologies. We use Self-Organizing Map neural networks whose n eighbourhood relationships are defined by a complex network, to classify handwr itten digits. We show that topology has a small impact on performance and robus tness to neuron failures, at least at long learning times. Performance may howe ver be increased (by almost 10%) by artificial evolution of the network topo logy. In our experimental conditions, the evolved networks are more random than their parents, but display a more heterogeneous degree distribution. "
"The theory of continued fractions has been generalized to l-adic numbers by several authors and presents many differences with respect to the real case. In the present paper we investigate the expansion of rationals and quadratic irrationals for the l-adic continued fractions introduced by Ruban. In this case, rational numbers may have a periodic non-terminating continued fraction expansion, moreover, for quadratic irrational numbers, no analogue of Lagrange's theorem holds. We give general explicit criteria to establish the periodicity of the expansion in both the rational and the quadratic case (for rationals, the qualitative result is due to Laohakosol). "
"In the recent years, WiFi standard has been used to develop different kind of wireless networks due to its flexibility and the availability of cheap off the shelf hardware. Even if the standard itself lacks mobility support, it has been used in networks with mobile nodes. When mobility is involved, a fast handoff is of paramount importance, especially with multimedia applications. The current IEEE 802.11 standard does not provide any specification about how the handoff should take place. In this paper we propose a handoff scheme optimized for networks providing wireless connection to mass transit vehicles. The structure of the procedure is redesigned to minimize delay as well as assure reliability. A reliable handoff triggering mechanism is also designed exploiting the results obtained from a set of preliminary outdoor experiments. The proposed scheme was implemented and deployed in an experimental testbed, and several indoor tests were run in order to demonstrate its reliability and efficiency. "
It is shown that spatially homogeneous solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a nonlinear scalar field and other matter exhibit accelerated expansion at late times for a wide variety of potentials $V$. These potentials are strictly positive but tend to zero at infinity. They satisfy restrictions on $V'/V$ and $V''/V'$ related to the slow-roll approximation. These results generalize Wald's theorem for spacetimes with positive cosmological constant to those with accelerated expansion driven by potentials belonging to a large class. 
"We present the results of systematic experimental investigations and micromagnetic simulations for the ferromagnetic resonance in rectangular permalloy microstripes. It is shown that the resonant magnetization oscillations have a complex spatial structure including a quasi-homogeneous precession, lateral spin-wave resonances and localized edge modes, which strongly depend on sample orientation in an external magnetic field. "
"ATLAS (Australia Telescope Large Area Survey) is a wide deep radio survey which is distinguished by its comprehensive multi-wavelength approach. ATLAS is creating a large dataset of radio-selected galaxies for studying the evolution and inter-relationship of star-forming and active galaxies. Although the project is far from complete, we are already starting to answer some of these questions, and have stumbled across three surprises along the way: * FRI/FRII radio-loud AGN embedded within spiral galaxies, * radio-bright AGN which are unexpectedly faint in the infrared, and which may be at high redshift * IR-luminous radio-quiet AGN which are partly responsible for the wide variations in reported values of the radio-infrared ratio These and other observations suggest that the AGN activity and star formation become increasingly inter-dependent at high redshifts.

"In the singularity and differential topological theory of Morse functions and higher dimensional versions or fold maps and application to algebraic and differential topology of manifolds, constructing explicit fold maps and investigating their source manifolds is fundamental, important and difficult. The author has introduced surgery operations (bubbling operations) to fold maps, motivated by studies of Kobayashi, Saeki etc. since 1990 and has explicitly shown that homology groups of Reeb spaces of maps constructed by iterations of these operations are flexible in several cases. Such operations seem to be strong tools in construction of maps and precise studies of manifolds. More precisely, the author has also noticed that the resulting groups are represented as direct sums of the original homology groups and suitable finitely generated commutative groups. The Reeb space of a map is the space of all connected components of inverse images of the maps. Reeb spaces inherit fundamental invariants of the manifolds such as homology groups etc. much in simple cases as polyhedra whose dimensions are equal to those of the target spaces. This paper is on a new explicit study of changes of homology groups of Reeb spaces of fold maps by the surgery operations. We present explicit changes obtained by an approach via elementary theory of sequences of numbers and fundamental continuous or differentiable functions. "
"Since the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in 1965, characterization of the CMB anisotropy angular power spectrum has become somewhat of a holy grail for experimental cosmology. Because CMB anisotropy measurements are difficult, the full potential of the CMB is only now being realized. Improvements in experimental techniques and detector technology have yielded an explosion of progress in the past couple of years resulting in the ability to use measurements of the CMB to place meaningful constraints on cosmological parameters. In this review, I discuss the theory behind the CMB but focus primarily on the experiments, reviewing briefly the history of CMB anisotropy measurements and focusing on the recent experiments that have revolutionized this field. Results from these modern experiments are reviewed and the cosmological implications discussed. I conclude with brief comments about the future of CMB physics. "
"Reflection statistics have not been well studied for optical random media whose mean refractive indices do not match with the refractive indices of their surrounding media. Here, we theoretically study how this refractive index mismatch between a one dimensional (1D) optical sample and its surrounding medium affects the reflection statistics in the weak disorder limit, when the fluctuation part of the refractive index (dn) is much smaller than the mismatch as well as the mean refractive index of the sample (dn << <n>). In the theoretical derivation, we perform a detailed calculation that results in the analytical forms of mean and standard deviation (STD) of the reflectance in terms of disorder parameters (dn and lc) in an index mismatched backscattering system. Particularly, the orders of disorder parameters in STD of the reflectance for index mismatched systems is shown to be lower ( (<dn^2> lc )^1/2 ) than that of the matched systems (<dn^2> lc). By comparing STDs of the reflection coefficient of index matched and mismatched systems, we show that reflectance at the sample boundaries in index mismatched systems can enhance the signal of the STD to the disorder parameters of the reflectance. In terms of biophotonics applications, this result can lead to potential techniques that effectively extract the sample disorder parameters by manipulating the index mismatch conditions. Potential applications of the technique for enhancement in sensitivity of cancer detection at single cell level are also discussed. "
"Motivated by the recent experiment by Grayson et.al., we investigate a non-ohmic current-voltage characteristics for the tunneling into fractional quantum Hall liquids. We give a possible explanation for the experiment in terms of the chiral Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. We study the interaction between the charge and neutral modes, and found that the leading order correction to the exponent $\alpha$ $(I\sim V^\alpha)$ is of the order of $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ $(\epsilon=v_n/v_c)$, which reduces the exponent $\alpha$. We suggest that it could explain the systematic discrepancy between the observed exponents and the exact $\alpha =1/\nu$ dependence. "
"Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggest that integral field spectroscopy can connect the high-order stellar kinematic moments h3 (~skewness) and h4 (~kurtosis) in galaxies to their cosmological assembly history. Here, we assess these results by measuring the stellar kinematics on a sample of 315 galaxies, without a morphological selection, using 2D integral field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. A proxy for the spin parameter ($\lambda_{R_e}$) and ellipticity ($\epsilon_e$) are used to separate fast and slow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regular rotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies. We confirm that regular rotators show a strong h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation, whereas quasi-regular and non-regular rotators show a more vertical relation in h3 and $V/\sigma$. Motivated by recent cosmological simulations, we develop an alternative approach to kinematically classify galaxies from their individual h3 versus $V/\sigma$ signatures. We identify five classes of high-order stellar kinematic signatures using Gaussian mixture models. Class 1 corresponds to slow rotators, whereas Classes 2-5 correspond to fast rotators. We find that galaxies with similar $\lambda_{R_e}-\epsilon_e$ values can show distinctly different h3-$V/\sigma$ signatures. Class 5 objects are previously unidentified fast rotators that show a weak h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation. These objects are predicted to be disk-less galaxies formed by gas-poor mergers. From morphological examination, however, there is evidence for large stellar disks. Instead, Class 5 objects are more likely disturbed galaxies, have counter-rotating bulges, or bars in edge-on galaxies. Finally, we interpret the strong anti-correlation in h3 versus $V/\sigma$ as evidence for disks in most fast rotators, suggesting a dearth of gas-poor mergers among fast rotators. "
"Considering the sets of subsums of series (or achievement sets) we show that for conditionally convergent series the multidimensional case is much more complicated than that of the real line. Although we are far from the full topological classification of such sets, we present many surprising examples and catch the ideas standing behind them in general theorems. "
"Each topological group $G$ admits a unique universal minimal dynamical system $(M(G),G)$. When $G$ is a non-compact locally compact group the phase space $M(G)$ of this universal system is non-metrizable. There are however topological groups for which $M(G)$ is the trivial one point system (extremely amenable groups), as well as topological groups $G$ for which $M(G)$ is a metrizable space and for which there is an explicit description of the dynamical system $(M(G),G)$. One such group is the topological group $S_\infty$ of all permutations of the integers ${\mathbb Z}$, with the topology of pointwise convergence. We show that $(M(S_\infty),S_\infty)$ is a symbolic dynamical system (hence in particular $M(S_\infty)$ is a Cantor set), and give a full description of all its symbolic factors. Among other facts we show that $(M(G),G)$ (and hence also every minimal $S_\infty$) has the structure of a two-to-one group extension of proximal system and that it is uniquely ergodic. "
"Over the years many He-He interaction potentials have been developed, some very sophisticated, including various corrections beyond Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Most of them were used to predict properties of helium dimers and trimers, examples of exotic quantum states, whose experimental study proved to be very challenging. Recently, detailed structural properties of helium trimers were measured for the first time, allowing a comparison with theoretical predictions and possibly enabling the evaluation of different interaction potentials. The comparisons already made included adjusting the maxima of both theoretical and experimental correlation functions to one, so the overall agreement between theory and experiment appeared satisfactory. However, no attempt was made to evaluate the quality of the interaction potentials used in the calculations. In this work, we calculate the experimentally measured correlation functions using both new and old potentials, compare them with experimental data and rank the potentials. We use diffusion Monte Carlo simulations at $T=0\ \mathrm{K}$, which give within statistical noise exact results of the ground state properties. All models predict both trimers $^4\mathrm{He}_{3}$ and $^4\mathrm{He}_2{}^3\mathrm{He}$ to be in a quantum halo state. "
"Consider the following Markov chain on permutations of length $n$. At each time step we choose a random position. If the letter at that position is smaller than the letter immediately to the left (cyclically) then these letters swap positions. Otherwise nothing happens, corresponding to a loop in the Markov chain. This is the circular TASEP. We compute the average proportion of time the chain spends at the identity permutation (and, in greater generality, at sorted words). This answers a conjecture by Thomas Lam. "
"Open-ended evolutionary dynamics remains an elusive goal for artificial evolutionary systems. Many ideas exist in the biological literature beyond the basic Darwinian requirements of variation, differential reproduction and inheritance. I argue that these ideas can be seen as aspects of five fundamental requirements for open-ended evolution: (1) robustly reproductive individuals, (2) a medium allowing the possible existence of a practically unlimited diversity of individuals and interactions, (3) individuals capable of producing more complex offspring, (4) mutational pathways to other viable individuals, and (5) drive for continued evolution. I briefly discuss implications of this view for the design of artificial systems with greater evolutionary potential. "
"We investigate the NBI matrix model with the potential $X\Lambda+X^{-1}+(2\eta+1)\log X$ recently proposed to describe IIB superstrings. With the proper normalization, using Virasoro constraints, we prove the equivalence of this model and the Kontsevich matrix model for $\eta\ne0$ and find the explicit transformation between the two models.

"The journey of the Sun through space carries the solar system through a dynamic interstellar environment that is presently characterized by Mach 1 motion between the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). The interaction between the heliosphere and ISM is an evolving process due to the variable solar wind and to interstellar turbulence. Frisch et al. presented a meta-analysis of the historical data on the interstellar wind flowing through the heliosphere and concluded that temporal changes in the ecliptic longitude of the wind were statistically indicated by the data available in the refereed literature at the time of that writing. Lallement and Bertaux disagree with this result, and suggested, for instance, that a key instrumental response function of IBEX-Lo was incorrect and that the STEREO pickup ion data are unsuitable for diagnosing the flow of interstellar neutrals through the heliosphere. Here we show that temporal variations in the interstellar wind through the heliosphere are consistent with our knowledge of local ISM. The statistical analysis of the historical helium wind data is revisited, and a recent correction of a typographical error in the literature is incorporated into the new fits. With this correction, and including no newer IBEX results, these combined data still indicate that a change in the longitude of the interstellar neutral wind over the past forty years is statistically likely, but that a constant flow longitude is now also statistically possible. It is shown that the IBEX instrumental response function is known, and that the STEREO pickup ion data have been correctly utilized in this analysis. "
"Ladder tournaments are widely used to rank individuals in real-world organizations and games. Their mathematical properties however are still poorly understood. We formalize the ranking rule generated by a ladder tournament, and we show that it is neither complete nor transitive in general. If it is complete, then it is transitive and its asymmetric component is a finite union of transitive tournaments. We also study the relationship between an individual's rank and his performance as measured by the frequency at which he is pivotal. We show an individual's pivotability is a weakly increasing function of his rank. "
"Game semantics describe the interactive behavior of proofs by interpreting formulas as games on which proofs induce strategies. Such a semantics is introduced here for capturing dependencies induced by quantifications in first-order propositional logic. One of the main difficulties that has to be faced during the elaboration of this kind of semantics is to characterize definable strategies, that is strategies which actually behave like a proof. This is usually done by restricting the model to strategies satisfying subtle combinatorial conditions, whose preservation under composition is often difficult to show. Here, we present an original methodology to achieve this task, which requires to combine advanced tools from game semantics, rewriting theory and categorical algebra. We introduce a diagrammatic presentation of the monoidal category of definable strategies of our model, by the means of generators and relations: those strategies can be generated from a finite set of atomic strategies and the equality between strategies admits a finite axiomatization, this equational structure corresponding to a polarized variation of the notion of bialgebra. This work thus bridges algebra and denotational semantics in order to reveal the structure of dependencies induced by first-order quantifiers, and lays the foundations for a mechanized analysis of causality in programming languages. "
"In this paper we will illustrate how to constrain unavoidable K\""ahler corrections for ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity (SUGRA) inflation from the recent Planck data. We will show that the non-renormalizable K\""ahler operators will induce in general non-minimal kinetic term for the inflaton field, and two types of SUGRA corrections in the potential - the Hubble-induced mass ($c_{H}$), and the Hubble-induced A-term ($a_{H}$) correction. The entire SUGRA inflationary framework can now be constrained from (i) the speed of sound, $c_s$, and (ii) from the upper bound on the tensor to scalar ratio, $r_{\star}$. We will illustrate this by considering a heavy scalar degree of freedom at a scale, $M_s$, and a light inflationary field which is responsible for a slow-roll inflation. We will compute the corrections to the kinetic term and the potential for the light field explicitly. As an example, we will consider a visible sector inflationary model of inflation where inflation occurs at the point of inflection, which can match the density perturbations for the cosmic microwave background radiation, and also explain why the universe is filled with the Standard Model degrees of freedom. We will scan the parameter space of the non-renormalizable K\""ahler operators, which we find them to be order ${\cal O}(1)$, consistent with physical arguments. While the scale of heavy physics is found to be bounded by the tensor-to scalar ratio, and the speed of sound, $ {\cal O}(10^{11}\leq M_s\leq 10^{16}) $GeV, for $0.02\leq c_s\leq 1$ and $10^{-22}\leq r_\star \leq 0.12$.

"Although representation learning methods developed within the framework of traditional neural networks are relatively mature, developing a spiking representation model remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes an event-based method to train a feedforward spiking neural network (SNN) layer for extracting visual features. The method introduces a novel spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule and a threshold adjustment rule both derived from a vector quantization-like objective function subject to a sparsity constraint. The STDP rule is obtained by the gradient of a vector quantization criterion that is converted to spike-based, spatio-temporally local update rules in a spiking network of leaky, integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Independence and sparsity of the model are achieved by the threshold adjustment rule and by a softmax function implementing inhibition in the representation layer consisting of WTA-thresholded spiking neurons. Together, these mechanisms implement a form of spike-based, competitive learning. Two sets of experiments are performed on the MNIST and natural image datasets. The results demonstrate a sparse spiking visual representation model with low reconstruction loss comparable with state-of-the-art visual coding approaches, yet our rule is local in both time and space, thus biologically plausible and hardware friendly. "
"Network alignment aims at inferring a set of anchor links matching the shared entities between different information networks, which has become a prerequisite step for effective fusion of multiple information networks. In this paper, we will study the network alignment problem to fuse online social networks specifically. Social network alignment is extremely challenging to address due to several reasons, i.e., lack of training data, network heterogeneity and one-to-one constraint. Existing network alignment works usually require a large number of training data, but such a demand can hardly be met in applications, as manual anchor link labeling is extremely expensive. Significantly different from other homogeneous network alignment works, information in online social networks is usually of heterogeneous categories, the incorporation of which in model building is not an easy task. Furthermore, the one-to-one cardinality constraint on anchor links renders their inference process intertwistingly correlated. To resolve these three challenges, a novel network alignment model, namely ActiveIter, is introduced in this paper. ActiveIter defines a set of inter-network meta diagrams for anchor link feature extraction, adopts active learning for effective label query and uses greedy link selection for anchor link cardinality filtering. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world aligned networks datasets, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of ActiveIter compared with other state-of-the-art baseline methods.

"In a multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem, agents need to navigate from their start to their goal locations without colliding into each other. There are various MAPF algorithms, including Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A*, Flow Annotated Replanning, and Bounded Multi-Agent A*. It is often the case that there is no a single algorithm that dominates all MAPF instances. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the use of deep learning to automatically select the best MAPF algorithm from a portfolio of algorithms for a given MAPF problem instance. Empirical results show that our automatic algorithm selection approach, which uses an off-the-shelf convolutional neural network, is able to outperform any individual MAPF algorithm in our portfolio.

"\noindent The galaxy IRAS F10214+4724, discovered in a spectroscopic survey of a 0.2 Jy sample by Rowan-Robinson and collaborators in 1991, is significantly more luminous than any other known galaxy. Its bolometric luminosity is comparable to those of the most luminous quasars. Recent obsservations have revealed a candidate foreground group of galaxies, which might gravitationally lens F10214+4724, thus explaining much of its luminosity. High-resolution imaging of F10214+4724 has revealed that most of its near-IR flux comes from a circularly symmetric arc; this also supports the gravitational lens interpretation. In such a scenario, F10214+4724 would be the high-redshift analogue of the ultraluminous IRAS galaxies observed locally. This work presents a simple statistical lensing model to investigate this possibility. "
"This work investigates new kinematic features of parallel manipulators. It is well known that parallel manipulators admit generally several direct kinematic solutions for a given set of input joint values. The aim of this paper is to characterize the uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators, as well as their image in the joint space. The study focuses on the most usual case of parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution. The notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link several solutions to the forward kinematic problem without meeting a singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. An additional set of surfaces, namely the characteristic surfaces, are characterized which divide the workspace into basic regions and yield new uniqueness domains. This study is illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the joint space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets. "
Let X be an arbitrary hyperbolic geodesic metric space and let G be a countable non-elementary weakly acylindrical group of isometries of X. We show that the second bounded cohomology group of G with real coefficients or with coefficients in the regular representation is infinite dimensional. The result holds for any subgroup of the mapping class group of a non-exceptional surface of finite type not containing a normal subgroup which virtually split as a direct product. 
High-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering has been used to determine the momentum dependence of orbital excitations in Mott-insulating LaTiO$_3$ and YTiO$_3$ over a wide range of the Brillouin zone. The data are compared to calculations in the framework of lattice-driven and superexchange-driven orbital ordering models. A superexchange model in which the experimentally observed modes are attributed to two-orbiton excitations yields the best description of the data. 
"We study several interesting examples of Biangular Tight Frames (BTFs) - basis-like sets of unit vectors admitting exactly two distinct frame angles (ie, pairwise absolute inner products) - and examine their relationships with Equiangular Tight Frames (ETFs) - basis-like systems which admit exactly one frame angle. We demonstrate a smooth parametrization BTFs, where the corresponding frame angles transform smoothly with the parameter, which ""passes through"" an ETF answers two questions regarding the rigidity of BTFs. We also develop a general framework of so-called harmonic BTFs and Steiner BTFs - which includes the equiangular cases, surprisingly, the development of this framework leads to a connection with the famous open problem(s) regarding the existence of Mersenne and Fermat primes. Finally, we construct a (chordally) biangular tight set of subspaces (ie, a tight fusion frame) which ""Pl\""ucker embeds"" into an ETF. "
"Hadoop is an open source implementation of the MapReduce Framework in the realm of distributed processing. A Hadoop cluster is a unique type of computational cluster designed for storing and analyzing large data sets across cluster of workstations. To handle massive scale data, Hadoop exploits the Hadoop Distributed File System termed as HDFS. The HDFS similar to most distributed file systems share a familiar problem on data sharing and availability among compute nodes, often which leads to decrease in performance. This paper is an experimental evaluation of Hadoop's computing performance which is made by designing a rack aware cluster that utilizes the Hadoop's default block placement policy to improve data availability. Additionally, an adaptive data replication scheme that relies on access count prediction using Langrange's interpolation is adapted to fit the scenario. To prove, experiments were conducted on a rack aware cluster setup which significantly reduced the task completion time, but once the volume of the data being processed increases there is a considerable cutback in computational speeds due to update cost. Further the threshold level for balance between the update cost and replication factor is identified and presented graphically. "

The non-crossing rule for the energy levels of a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian is revisited and a flaw in a commonly accepted proof is revealed. Some aspects of avoided crossings are illustrated by means of simple models. One of them shows the close relationship between avoided crossings and exceptional points.

"Hundreds of candidate hybrid pulsators of intermediate type A-F were revealed by the recent space missions. Hybrid pulsators allow to study the full stellar interiors, where p- and g-modes are simultaneously excited. The true hybrid stars must be identified since other processes, due to stellar multiplicity or rotation, might explain the presence of (some) low frequencies observed in their periodograms. We measured the radial velocities of 50 candidate Delta Sct - Gamma Dor hybrid stars from the Kepler mission with the Hermes/Ace spectrographs over a span of months to years. We aim to derive the fraction of binary and multiple systems and to provide an independent and homogeneous determination of the atmospheric properties and vsini for all targets. The objective is to identify the physical cause of the low frequencies. We computed 1-D cross-correlation functions (CCFs) in order to find the best parameters in terms of the number of components, spectral type and vsini for each target. Radial velocities were measured from spectrum synthesis and by using a 2-D cross-correlation technique in the case of double- and triple-lined systems. Fundamental parameters were determined by fitting (composite) synthetic spectra to the normalised median spectra corrected for the appropriate Doppler shifts. We report on the analysis of 478 high-resolution Hermes and 41 Ace spectra of A/F-type candidate hybrid pulsators from the Kepler field. We determined their radial velocities, projected rotational velocities, atmospheric properties and classified our targets based on the shape of the CCFs and the temporal behaviour of the radial velocities. We derived orbital solutions for seven new systems. Three long-period preliminary orbital solutions are confirmed by a photometric time-delay analysis. Finally, we determined a global multiplicity fraction of 27% in our sample of candidate hybrid stars. "
"Despite being studied for over a century, the use of quadrupoles have been limited to Cartesian coordinates in flat spacetime due to the incorrect transformation rules used to define them. Here the correct transformation rules are derived, which are particularly unusual as they involve second derivatives of the coordinate transformation and an integral. Transformations involving integrals have not been seen before. This is significantly different from the familiar transformation rules for a dipole, where the components transform as tensors. It enables quadrupoles to be correctly defined in general relativity and to prescribe the equations of motion for a quadrupole in a coordinate system adapted to its motion and then transform them to the laboratory coordinates. An example is given of another unusual feature: a quadrupole which is free of dipole terms in polar coordinates has dipole terms in Cartesian coordinates. It is shown that dipoles, electric dipoles, quadrupoles and electric quadrupoles can be defined without reference to a metric and in a coordinates free manner. This is particularly useful given their complicated coordinate transformation. "
"The exact critical Casimir force between periodically deformed boundaries of a 2D semi-infinite strip is obtained for conformally invariant classical systems. Only two parameters (conformal charge and scaling dimension of a boundary changing operator), along withthe solution of an electrostatic problem, determine the Casimir force, rendering the theory practically applicable to any shape and arrangement. The attraction between any two mirror symmetric objects follows directly from our general result. The possibility of purely shape induced reversal of the force, as well as occurrence of stable equilibrium points, is demonstrated for certain conformally invariant models, including the tricritical Ising model.

"It is anticipated that forthcoming, next generation, atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays will include a number of medium-sized telescopes that are constructed using a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration. These telescopes will sample a wide ($8^{\circ}$) field of view using a densely pixelated camera comprising over $10^{4}$ individual readout channels. A readout frequency congruent with the expected single-telescope trigger rates would result in substantial data rates. To ameliorate these data rates, a novel, hardware-level Distributed Intelligent Array Trigger (DIAT) is envisioned. A copy of the DIAT operates autonomously at each telescope and uses reduced resolution imaging data from a limited subset of nearby telescopes to veto events prior to camera readout {and any subsequent network transmission of camera data that is required for centralized storage or aggregation}. We present the results of Monte-Carlo simulations that evaluate the efficacy of a ""Parallax width"" discriminator that can be used by the DIAT to efficiently distinguish between genuine gamma-ray initiated events and unwanted background events that are initiated by hadronic cosmic rays.

We study condensation of open string tachyons using renormalization group flow in the worldsheet field theory. This approach leads to a simple picture of the physics of the nontrivial condensate. 
"We develop a simplified light source at 461 nm for laser cooling of Sr without frequency-doubling crystals but with blue laser diodes. An anti-reflection coated blue laser diode in an external cavity (Littrow) configuration provides an output power of 40 mW at 461 nm. Another blue laser diode is used to amplify the laser power up to 110 mW by injection locking. For frequency stabilization, we demonstrate modulation-free polarization spectroscopy of Sr in a hollow cathode lamp. The simplification of the laser system achieved in this work is of great importance for the construction of transportable optical lattice clocks. "
"Given a Lebesgue integrable function $f$ over $[0,2\pi]$, we consider the sequence of matrices $\{Y_nT_n[f]\}_n$, where $T_n[f]$ is the $n$-by-$n$ Toeplitz matrix generated by $f$ and $Y_n$ is the flip permutation matrix, also called the anti-identity matrix. Because of the unitary character of $Y_n$, the singular values of $T_n[f]$ and $Y_n T_n[f]$ coincide. However, the eigenvalues are affected substantially by the action of the matrix $Y_n$. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients are real, we prove that $\{Y_nT_n[f]\}_n$ is distributed in the eigenvalue sense as \[ \phi_g(\theta)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc} g(\theta), & \theta\in [0,2\pi], -g(-\theta), & \theta\in [-2\pi,0), \end{array} \right.\, \] with $g(\theta)=|f(\theta)|$. We also consider the preconditioning introduced by Pestana and Wathen and, by using the same arguments, we prove that the preconditioned sequence is distributed in the eigenvalue sense as $\phi_1$, under the mild assumption that $f$ is sparsely vanishing. We emphasize that the mathematical tools introduced in this setting have a general character and in fact can be potentially used in different contexts. A number of numerical experiments are provided and critically discussed. "
"Statistical theory of turbulence in viscid incompressible fluid, described by the Navier-Stokes equation driven by random force, is reformulated in terms of scale-dependent fields $\mathbf{u}_a(x)$, defined as wavelet-coefficients of the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ taken at point $x$ with the resolution $a$. Applying quantum field theory approach of stochastic hydrodynamics to the generating functional of random fields $\mathbf{u}_a(x)$, we have shown the velocity field correlators $\langle \mathbf{u}_{a_1}(x_1)\ldots \mathbf{u}_{a_n}(x_n)\rangle$ to be finite by construction for the random stirring force acting at prescribed large scale $L$. The study is performed in $d=3$ dimension. Since there are no divergences, regularization is not required, and the renormalization group invariance becomes merely a symmetry that relates velocity fluctuations of different scales in terms of the Kolmogorov-Richardson picture of turbulence development. The integration over the scale arguments is performed from the external scale $L$ down to the observation scale $A$, which lies in Kolmogorov range $l \ll A \ll L$. Our oversimplified model is full dissipative: interaction between scales is provided only locally by the gradient vertex $(\mathbf{u}\nabla) \mathbf{u}$, neglecting any effects or parity violation that might be responsible for energy backscatter. The corrections to viscosity and the pair velocity correlator are calculated in one-loop approximation. This gives the dependence of turbulent viscosity on observation scale and describes the scale dependence of the velocity field correlations. "
"Current outdoor mobile network infrastructure cannot support uplink intensive mobile applications such as connected vehicles that collect and upload large amount of real time data. Our investigation reveals that with maximum-ratio (MR) decoding, it is theoretically impossible to support such applications with cell-free Massive MIMO, and it requires a very large number of service antennas in single cell configuration, making it practically infeasible; but with zero-forcing (ZF) decoding, such applications can be easily supported by cell-free Massive MIMO with very moderate number of access points (AP's), and it requires a lot more service antennas in single cell configuration. Via the newly derived SINR expressions for cell-free Massive MIMO with ZF decoding we show that uplink power control is unnecessary, and that with 10 MHz effective bandwidth for uplink data transmission, in urban and suburban morphologies, on the 2 GHz band, 90 single antenna AP's per square kilometer and 32 single antenna AP's per square kilometer are enough to support 18 autonomous vehicles respectively. In rural morphology, using 450 MHz band, only 2 single antenna AP's per square kilometer is enough. "
"Fully Differential Cross Sections (FDCS) for single electron capture from helium by heavy ion impact are calculated using a frozen core 3-Body model and an active electron 4-Body model within the first Born approximation. FDCS are presented for H+, He2+, Li3+, and C6+ projectiles with velocities of 100 keV/amu, 1 MeV/amu, and 10 MeV/amu. In general, the FDCS from the two models are found to differ by about one order of magnitude with the active electron 4-Body model showing better agreement with experiment. Comparison of the models reveals two possible sources of the magnitude difference: the inactive electron's change of state and the projectile-target Coulomb interaction used in the different models. Detailed analysis indicates that the uncaptured electron's change of state can safely be neglected in the frozen core approximation, but that care must be used in modeling the projectile-target interaction. "
"We calculate the NMR relaxation rate due to quadrupolar coupling of the nucleus to a local, strongly anharmonic phonon mode. As a model potential for a rattling motion we consider a square-well potential. We calculate the free phonon Green's function analytically and derive the low and high temperature limits of the NMR relaxation rate. It is shown that the temperature dependence of the NMR relaxation rate possesses a peak in contrast to harmonic phonons but in qualitative agreement with a recent NMR study on KOs2O6. We discuss the influence of phonon renormalization due to electron-phonon interaction. "
"Based on the standard many-fermion field theory, the authors construct models describing ultracold fermions in a 1D optical lattices by implementing a mode expansion of the fermionic field operator where modes, in addition to space localization, take into account the quantum numbers inherent in local fermion interactions. The resulting models are generalized Hubbard Hamiltonians whose interaction parameters are derived by a fully-analytical calculation. The special interest for this derivation resides in its model-generating capability and in the flexibility of the trapping techniques that allow the tuning of the Hamiltonian interaction parameters over a wide range of values. While the Hubbard Hamiltonian is recovered in a very low-density regime for a fermionic system, in general, far more complicated Hamiltonians characterise high-density regimes, revealing a rich scenario for both the phenomenology of interacting trapped fermions and the experimental realization of devices for quantum information processing. As a first example of the different situations that may arise beyond the models well known in the literature (the unpolarized-spin fermion model and the noninteracting spin-polarized fermion model), we derive a Rotational Hubbard Hamiltonian describing the local rotational activity of spin-polarized fermions. Based on a standard techniques we obtain the mean-field version of our model Hamiltonian and show how different dynamical algebras characterize the case of attractive and repulsive two-body potentials.

"To further improve the potential of full-duplex communications, networks may employ multiple antennas at the base station or user equipment. To this end, networks that employ current radios usually deal with self-interference and multi-user interference by beamforming techniques. Although previous works investigated beamforming design to improve spectral efficiency, the fundamental question of how to split the antennas at a base station between uplink and downlink in full-duplex networks has not been investigated rigorously. This paper addresses this question by posing antenna splitting as a binary nonlinear optimization problem to minimize the sum mean squared error of the received data symbols. It is shown that this is an NP-hard problem. This combinatorial problem is dealt with by equivalent formulations, iterative convex approximations, and a binary relaxation. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary solution of the relaxed problem with much smaller complexity than exhaustive search. Numerical results indicate that the proposed solution is close to the optimal in both high and low self-interference capable scenarios, while the usually assumed antenna splitting is far from optimal. For large number of antennas, a simple antenna splitting is close to the proposed solution. This reveals that the importance of antenna splitting is inversely proportional with the number of antennas. "
"We present the library Collier for the numerical evaluation of one-loop scalar and tensor integrals in perturbative relativistic quantum field theories. The code provides numerical results for arbitrary tensor and scalar integrals for scattering processes in general quantum field theories. For tensor integrals either the coefficients in a covariant decomposition or the tensor components themselves are provided. Collier supports complex masses, which are needed in calculations involving unstable particles. Ultraviolet and infrared singularities are treated in dimensional regularization. For soft and collinear singularities mass regularization is available as an alternative. "
"We generalize the notion of a graph automatic group introduced by Kharlampovich, Khoussainov and Miasnikov (arXiv:1107.3645) by replacing the regular languages in their definition with more powerful language classes. For a fixed language class $\mathcal C$, we call the resulting groups $\mathcal C$-graph automatic. We prove that the class of $\mathcal C$-graph automatic groups is closed under change of generating set, direct and free product for certain classes $\mathcal C$. We show that for quasi-realtime counter-graph automatic groups where normal forms have length that is linear in the geodesic length, there is an algorithm to compute normal forms (and therefore solve the word problem) in polynomial time. The class of quasi-realtime counter-graph automatic groups includes all Baumslag-Solitar groups, and the free group of countably infinite rank. Context-sensitive-graph automatic groups are shown to be a very large class, which encompasses, for example, groups with unsolvable conjugacy problem, the Grigorchuk group, and Thompson's groups $F,T$ and $V$. "
"The femtocaching idea was proposed as a solution to compensate for the weak backhaul capacity, by deploying coverage-limited nodes with high storage capacity called femtocaches (FCs). In this paper, the macrocell offloading problem in femtocaching-assisted cellular networks is investigated. The objective is to minimize the number of transmissions by the macrocell base station (MBS) given that all requests should be served simultaneously to satisfy quality-of-experience (QoE) of the clients. We first formulate this MBS offloading problem as an optimization problem over a network coding graph, and show that it is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose an ONC-broadcast offloading scheme that exploits both broadcasting and opportunistic network coding (ONC) to minimize the number of required MBS transmissions. We utilize a random graph model to approximate the performance of the proposed ONC-broadcast scheme in terms of the resultant average number of transmissions by the MBS. Moreover, despite the complexity of finding the optimal solution for each and every case, we prove that this ONC-broadcast scheme is asymptotically optimal, i.e., for large number of requests, the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a similar macrocell offloading performance to that of the optimal solution. To implement the ONC-broadcast scheme, we devise a heuristic that employs a dual conflict graph or broadcasting at the FCs such that the remaining requests can be served using the minimum number of transmissions at the MBS. Simulations show that the dual graph scheme improves MBS offloading as compared to the traditional separate graph scheme. Furthermore, the simple heuristic proposed to implement the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a very close performance to the optimal ONC-broadcast scheme. "
The recent application of Fourier Based Iterative Reconstruction Method (FIRM) has made it possible to achieve high-quality 2D images from a fan beam Computed Tomography (CT) scan with a limited number of projections in a fast manner. The proposed methodology in this article is designed to provide 3D Radon space in linogram fashion to facilitate the use of FIRM with cone beam projections (CBP) for the reconstruction of 3D images in a low dose Cone Beam CT (CBCT). 
"We use the current weak lensing data to constrain the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the total mass of massive neutrinos $\sum m_{\nu}$. The constraint on $w$ would be weak if only the current weak lensing data are used. With the addition of other observational data such as the type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, and the high redshift Hubble parameter data $H(z)$ derived from relative galaxy ages to break the degeneracy, the result is significantly improved. For the pure $w$CDM model without massive neutrinos, we find $w=-1.00^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$. For the $w$CDM model with the massive neutrino component, we show that the constraint on $w$ is almost unchanged, there is very little degeneracy between $w$ and $\sum m_{\nu}$. After marginalizing over other parameters, we obtain the probability distribution function of $\sum m_{\nu}$, and find that the upper limit is $\sum m_{\nu} \leq 0.8$ eV at 95.5% confidence level for the combined data sets. Our constraints of $w$ and $\sum m_{\nu}$ are both compatible and comparable with the constraints obtained from the WMAP 5-year data. "
"Davis and Knuth in 1970 introduced the notion of revolving sequences, as representations of a Gaussian integer. Later, Mizutani and Ito pointed out a close relationship between a set of points determined by all revolving sequences and a self-similar set, which is called the Dragon, from the viewpoint of symbolic dynamical systems. We will show how their result can be generalized by a completely different approach. "
"We present a study on low-$T_c$ superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor (SIFS) Josephson junctions. SIFS junctions have gained considerable interest in recent years because they show a number of interesting properties for future classical and quantum computing devices. We optimized the fabrication process of these junctions to achieve a homogeneous current transport, ending up with high-quality samples. Depending on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer and on temperature, the SIFS junctions are in the ground state with a phase drop either 0 or $\pi$. By using a ferromagnetic layer with variable step-like thickness along the junction, we obtained a so-called 0-$\pi$ Josephson junction, in which 0 and $\pi$ ground states compete with each other. At a certain temperature the 0 and $\pi$ parts of the junction are perfectly symmetric, i.e. the absolute critical current densities are equal. In this case the degenerate ground state corresponds to a vortex of supercurrent circulating clock- or counterclockwise and creating a magnetic flux which carries a fraction of the magnetic flux quantum $\Phi_0$. "
"In this paper, we relate the framework of mod-$\phi$ convergence to the construction of approximation schemes for lattice-distributed random variables. The point of view taken here is that of Fourier analysis in the Wiener algebra, allowing the computation of asymptotic equivalents in the local, Kolmogorov and total variation distances. By using signed measures instead of probability measures, we are able to construct better approximations of discrete lattice distributions than the standard Poisson approximation. This theory applies to various examples arising from combinatorics and number theory: number of cycles in (possibly coloured) permutations, number of prime divisors (possibly within different residue classes) of a random integer, number of irreducible factors of a random polynomial, etc. One advantage of the approach developed in this paper is that it allows us to deal with approximations in higher dimensions as well. In this setting, we can explicitly see the influence of the correlations between the components of the random vectors in our asymptotic formulas. "
"This article studies some numerical approximations of the homogenized matrix for stochastic linear elliptic partial differential equations in divergence form. We focus on the case when the underlying random field is a small perturbation of a reference periodic tensor. The size of such a perturbation is encoded by a real parameter eta. In this case, it has already been theoretically shown in the literature that the exact homogenized matrix possesses an expansion in powers of the parameter eta for both models considered in this article, the coefficients of which are deterministic. In practice, one cannot manipulate the exact terms of such an expansion. All objects are subjected to a discretization approach. Thus we need to derive a similar expansion for the approximated random homogenized matrix. In contrast to the expansion of the exact homogenized matrix, the expansion of the approximated homogenized matrix contains intrinsically random coefficients. In particular, the second order term is random in nature. The purpose of this work is to derive and study this expansion in function of the parameters of the approximation procedure (size of the truncated computational domain used, meshsize of the finite elements approximation). "
"We study asymptotic distribution of eigen-values $\omega$ of a quadratic operator polynomial of the following form $(\omega^2-L(\omega))\phi_\omega=0$, where $L(\omega)$ is a second order differential positive elliptic operator with quadratic dependence on the spectral parameter $\omega$. We derive asymptotics of the spectral density in this problem and show how to compute coefficients of its asymptotic expansion from coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel of $L(\omega)$. The leading term in the spectral asymptotics is the same as for a Laplacian in a cavity. The results have a number of physical applications. We illustrate them by examples of field equations in external stationary gravitational and gauge backgrounds. "
"The physical fields (electromagnetic and electron fields) considered in the framework of Clifford algebras $\C_2$ and $\C_4$. The electron field described by the algebra $\C_4$ which in spinor representation is realized by well-known Dirac $\gamma$-matrices, and by force of isomorphism $\C_{4}\cong\C_{2}\otimes \C_{2}$ is represented as a tensor product of two photon fields. By means of this introduced a system of electron field equations, which in particular cases is coincide with Dirac's and Maxwell's equations. "
"Vortex element methods are often used to efficiently simulate incompressible flows using Lagrangian techniques. Use of the FMM (Fast Multipole Method) allows considerable speed up of both velocity evaluation and vorticity evolution terms in these methods. Both equations require field evaluation of constrained (divergence free) vector valued quantities (velocity, vorticity) and cross terms from these. These are usually evaluated by performing several FMM accelerated sums of scalar harmonic functions. We present a formulation of the vortex methods based on the Lamb-Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity in terms of two scalar potentials. In its original form, this decomposition is not invariant with respect to translation, violating a key requirement for the FMM. One of the key contributions of this paper is a theory for translation for this representation. The translation theory is developed by introducing ""conversion"" operators, which enable the representation to be restored in an arbitrary reference frame. Using this form, extremely efficient vortex element computations can be made, which need evaluation of just two scalar harmonic FMM sums for evaluating the velocity and vorticity evolution terms. Details of the decomposition, translation and conversion formulae, and sample numerical results are presented. "
"Ergodic and combinatorial results obtained in [10] involved measure preserving actions of the affine group ${\mathcal A}_K$ of a countable field $K$. In this paper we develop a new approach based on ultrafilter limits which allows one to refine and extend the results obtained in [10] to a more general situation involving the measure preserving actions of the non-amenable affine semigroups of a large class of integral domains. (The results in [10] heavily depend on the amenability of the affine group of a field). Among other things, we obtain, as a corollary of an ultrafilter ergodic theorem, the following result: Let $K$ be a number field and let ${\mathcal O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. For any finite partition $K=C_1\cup\cdots\cup C_r$ there exists $i\in\{1,\dots,r\}$ and many $x\in K$ and $y\in{\mathcal O}_K$ such that $\{x+y,xy\}\subset C_i$. "
"Classical black hole analogues (alternatively, the analogue systems) are fluid dynamical analogue of general relativistic black holes. Such analogue effects may be observed when acoustic perturbations (sound waves) propagate through a classical dissipation-less tran-sonic fluid. The acoustic horizon, which resembles the actual black hole event horizon in many ways, may be generated at the transonic point in the fluid flow. Acoustic horizon emits quasi thermal phonon spectra, which is analogous to the actual Hawking radiation, and possesses the temperature referred as the analogue Hawking temperature, or simply, the analogue temperature. Transonic accretion onto astrophysical black holes is a very interesting example of classical analogue system found naturally in the Universe. An accreting black holes system as a classical analogue is unique in the sense that only for such a system, both kind of horizons, the electromagnetic and the acoustic (generated due to transonicity of accreting fluid) are simultaneously present in the same system. Hence an accreting astrophysical black hole is the ideal-most candidate to theoretically study and to compare the properties of these two different kind of horizons. Also such system is unique in the aspect that general relativistic spherical accretion onto the Schwarzschild black hole represents the only classical analogue system found in the nature so far, where the analogue Hawking temperature may be higher than the actual Hawking temperature.

"The analysis of over ten years of commercial development using Agile (10,100 unique task estimates made by 22 developers, under 20 project codes) is documented via a conversation involving the data analyst and a director of the company that created the SiP dataset. Factors found to influence task implementation effort estimation accuracy include the person making the estimate, the project involved, and the propensity to use round numbers. Any improvement in estimation accuracy, with practice, did not noticeably improve regression models fitted. "
"Analyses for $^{81}$Kr and noble gases on groundwater from the deepest aquifer system of the Baltic Artesian Basin (BAB) were performed to determine groundwater ages and uncover the flow dynamics of the system on a timescale of several hundred thousand years. We find that the system is controlled by mixing of three distinct water masses: Interglacial or recent meteoric water $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \approx -10.4\unicode{x2030})$ with a poorly evolved chemical and noble gas signature, glacial meltwater $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \leq -18\unicode{x2030})$ with elevated noble gas concentrations, and an old, high-salinity brine component $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \geq -4.5\unicode{x2030}, \geq 90 \text{g Cl}^{-}/\text{L})$ with strongly depleted atmospheric noble gas concentrations. The $^{81}$Kr measurements are interpreted within this mixing framework to estimate the age of the end-members. Deconvoluted $^{81}$Kr ages range from 300 ka to 1.3 Ma for interglacial or recent meteoric water and glacial meltwater. For the brine component, ages exceed the dating range of the ATTA 3 instrument of 1.3 Ma. The radiogenic noble gas components $^{4}$He* and $^{40}$Ar* are less conclusive but also support an age of > 1 Ma for the brine. Based on the chemical and noble gas concentrations and the dating results, we conclude that the brine originates from evaporated seawater that has been modified by later water-rock interaction. As the obtained tracer ages cover several glacial cycles, we discuss the impact of the glacial cycles on flow patterns in the studied aquifer system. "
"The formal verification and controller synthesis for Markov decision processes that evolve over uncountable state spaces are computationally hard and thus generally rely on the use of approximations. In this work, we consider the correct-by-design control of general Markov decision processes (gMDPs) with respect to temporal logic properties by leveraging approximate probabilistic relations between the original model and its abstraction. We newly work with a robust satisfaction for the construction and verification of control strategies, which allows for both deviations in the outputs of the gMDPs and in the probabilistic transitions. The computation is done over the reduced or abstracted models, such that when a property is robustly satisfied on the abstract model, it is also satisfied on the original model with respect to a refined control strategy. "
"Technology trends will cause data movement to account for the majority of energy expenditure and execution time on emerging computers. Therefore, computational complexity will no longer be a sufficient metric for comparing algorithms, and a fundamental characterization of data access complexity will be increasingly important. The problem of developing lower bounds for data access complexity has been modeled using the formalism of Hong & Kung's red/blue pebble game for computational directed acyclic graphs (CDAGs). However, previously developed approaches to lower bounds analysis for the red/blue pebble game are very limited in effectiveness when applied to CDAGs of real programs, with computations comprised of multiple sub-computations with differing DAG structure. We address this problem by developing an approach for effectively composing lower bounds based on graph decomposition. We also develop a static analysis algorithm to derive the asymptotic data-access lower bounds of programs, as a function of the problem size and cache size. "
"The standard approach for studying the periodic ARMA model with coefficients that vary over the seasons is to express it in a vector form. In this paper we introduce an alternative method which views the periodic formulation as a time varying univariate process and obviates the need for vector analysis. The specification, interpretation, and solution of a periodic ARMA process enable us to formulate a forecasting method which avoids recursion and allows us to obtain analytic expressions of the optimal predictors. Our results on periodic models are general, analogous to those for stationary specifications, and place the former on the same computational basis as the latter. "
"We consider stationary matter-wave gap solitons realized in Bose--Einstein condensates loaded in one-dimensional (1D) optical lattices and investigate whether the effective 1D equation proposed in [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{77}, 013617 (2008)] can be a reliable alternative to the three-dimensional treatment of this kind of system in terms of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Our results demonstrate that, unlike the standard 1D GPE (which is not applicable in most realistic situations), the above effective model is able to correctly predict the distinctive trajectories characterizing the different gap soliton families as well as the corresponding axial wavefunctions along the entire band gaps. It can also predict the stability properties of the different gap soliton families as follows from both a linear stability analysis and a representative set of numerical computations. In particular, by numerically solving the corresponding Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations we show that the effective 1D model gives the correct spectrum of complex eigenfrequencies responsible for the dynamical stability of the system, thus providing us with a useful tool for the physical description of stationary matter-wave gap solitons in 1D optical lattices. "
"We present an analysis of recent X-ray observations of the symbiotic star AG Peg. The X-ray emission of AG Peg as observed with Swift in 2015 shows considerable variability on time scale of days as variability on shorter time scales might be present as well. Analysis of the X-ray spectra obtained in 2013 and 2015 confirms that AG Peg is an X-ray source of class $\beta$ of the X-ray sources amongst the symbiotic stars. The X-ray emission of AG Peg as observed with ROSAT (1993 June) might well originate from colliding stellar winds (CSW) in binary system. On the other hand, the characteristics of the X-ray emission of AG Peg in 2013 and 2015 (Swift) are hard to accommodate in the framework of the CSW picture. Analysis of the light curves in 2015 shows that the power spectrum of the X-ray variability in AG Peg resembles that of the flicker noise (or flickering) being typical for accretion processes in astronomical objects. This is a sign that CSWs did not play a key role for the X-ray emission from AG Peg in 2013-2015 and a different mechanism (probably accretion) is also getting into play. "
"An integro-differential equation of hyperbolic type, with mixed boundary conditions, is considered. A continuous space-time finite element method of degree one is formulated. A posteriori error representations based on space-time cells is presented such that it can be used for adaptive strategies based on dual weighted residual methods. A posteriori error estimates based on weighted global projections and local projections are also proved. "
"This paper is the first part in a 2 part study of an elementary functorial construction from the category of finite non-abelian groups to a category of singular compact, oriented 2-manifolds. After a desingularization process this construction results in a collection of compact, connected, oriented tesselated smooth surfaces equipped with a closed-cell structure which is face and edge transitive and which has at most 2 orbits of vertices. These tesselated surfaces can also be viewed as abstract 3-polytopes (or as graph embeddings in the corresponding surface) which are either equivar or dual to abstract quasiregular polytopes. This construction generally results in a large collection of tesselated surfaces per group, for example when the construction is applied to \Sigma_6 it yields 4477 tesselated surfaces of 27 distinct genus and even more varieties of tesselation cell structure. We study the distribution of these surfaces in various groups and some interesting resulting tesselations. In a second paper, we show that extensions of groups result in branched coverings between the component surfaces in their decompositions. We also exploit functoriality to obtain interesting faithful, orientation preserving actions of subquotients of these groups and their automorphism groups on these surfaces and in the corresponding mapping class groups. "
"In this paper, we propose a novel sparse signal recovery algorithm called Trainable ISTA (TISTA). The proposed algorithm consists of two estimation units such as a linear estimation unit and a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator-based shrinkage unit. The estimated error variance required in the MMSE shrinkage unit is precisely estimated from a tentative estimate of the original signal. The remarkable feature of the proposed scheme is that TISTA includes adjustable variables controlling a step size and the error variance for the MMSE shrinkage. The variables are adjusted by standard deep learning techniques. The number of trainable variables of TISTA is equal to the number of iteration rounds and it is much smaller than that of known learnable sparse signal recovery algorithms. This feature leads to highly stable and fast training processes of TISTA. Computer experiments show that TISTA is applicable to various classes of sensing matrices such as Gaussian matrices, binary matrices and matrices with large condition numbers. Numerical results also demonstrate that TISTA shows significantly faster convergence than those of AMP and LISTA in many cases. "
"Interplanetary (IP) shock plays a key role in causing the global dynamic changes of the geospace environment. For the perspective of Solar-Terrestrial relationship, it will be of great importance to estimate the properties of post-shock solar wind simply and accurately. Motivated by this, we performed a statistical analysis of IP shocks during 1998-2008, focusing on the significantly different responses of two well-used geomagnetic indices (SYMH and AL) to the passive of two types of IP shocks. For the IP shocks with northward IMF (91 cases), the SYMH index keeps on the high level after the sudden impulses (SI) for a long time. Meanwhile, the change of AL index is relative small, with an mean value of only -29 nT. However, for the IP shocks with southward IMF (92 cases), the SYMH index suddenly decreases at a certain rate after SI, and the change of AL index is much significant, of -316 nT. Furthermore, the change rate of SYMH index after SI is found to be linearly correlated with the post-shock reconnection E-field (E$_{KL}$). Based on these facts, an inversion model of post-shock IMF orientation and E$_{KL}$ is developed. The model validity is also confirmed by studying 68 IP shocks in the period of 2009-2013. The inversion accuracy of IMF orientation is 88.24%, and the inversion efficiency of E$_{KL}$ is as high as 78%. "
"Given a positive definite binary quadratic form f, let r(n) = |{(x,y): f(x,y)=n}| denote its representation function. In this paper we study linear correlations of these functions. For example, if r_1, ..., r_k are representation functions, we obtain an asymptotic for sum_{n,d} r_1(n) r_2(n+d) ... r_k(n+ (k-1)d). "
"We study the dynamics of super-Eddington accretion flows by performing two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Compared with previous works, in this paper we include the $T_{\theta\phi}$ component of the viscous stress and consider various values of the viscous parameter $\alpha$. We find that when $T_{\theta\phi}$ is included, the rotational speed of the high-latitude flow decreases, while the density increases and decreases at the high and low latitudes, respectively. We calculate the radial profiles of inflow and outflow rates. We find that the inflow rate decreases inward, following a power law form of $\dot{M}_{\rm in}\propto r^s$. The value of $s$ depends on the magnitude of $\alpha$ and is within the range of $\sim 0.4-1.0$. Correspondingly, the radial profile of density becomes flatter compared with the case of a constant $\dot{M}(r)$. We find that the density profile can be described by $\rho(r)\propto r^{-p}$, and the value of $p$ is almost same for a wide range of $\alpha$ ranging from $\alpha=0.1$ to $0.005$. The inward decrease of inflow accretion rate is very similar to hot accretion flows, which is attributed to the mass loss in outflows. To study the origin of outflow, we analyze the convective stability of slim disk. We find that depending on the value of $\alpha$, the flow is marginally stable (when $\alpha$ is small) or unstable (when $\alpha$ is large). This is different from the case of hydrodynamical hot accretion flow where radiation is dynamically unimportant and the flow is always convectively unstable. We speculate that the reason for the difference is because radiation can stabilize convection. The origin of outflow is thus likely because of the joint function of convection and radiation, but further investigation is required. "
"Watson-Crick automata are finite automata working on double strands. Extensive research work has already been done on non-deterministic Watson-Crick automata and on deterministic Watson-Crick automata. In this paper, we introduce a new model of Watson-Crick automata which is reversible in nature named reversible Watson-Crick automata and explore its computational power. We show even though the model is reversible and one way it accepts all regular languages and also analyze the state complexity of the above stated model with respect to non-deterministic block automata and non-deterministic finite automata and establish its superiority. We further explore the relation of the reversible model with twin-shuffle language and recursively enumerable languages. "
"The dynamical and radiative properties of the quiescent state (X-ray luminosity $<10^{34}\ {\rm erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$) of black hole X-ray transients (BHXTs) remains unclear, mainly because of low-luminosity and poor data quantity. We demonstrate that, the simultaneous multi-wavelength (including radio, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray bands) spectrum of V404 Cyg in its bright quiescent state can be well described by the radiation from the companion star and more importantly, the compact jet. Neither the outer thin disc nor the inner hot accretion flow is important in the total spectrum. Together with several additional recent findings, i.e. the power-law X-ray spectrum and the constant X-ray spectral shape (or constant photon index) in contrast to the dramatic change in the X-ray luminosity, we argue the quiescent state spectrum of BHXTs is actually jet-dominated. Observational features consistent with this jet model are also discussed as supporting evidences. "
"Nonlinear PDEs, mean value properties, and stochastic differential games are intrinsically connected. In this short expository note, we will describe how the solutions to certain PDEs (of $p$-Laplacian type) can be interpreted as limits of values of a specific Tug-of-War game, when the step-size $\epsilon$ determining the allowed length of move of a token, decreases to $0$. "
"We prove the existence of ground state in a multidimensional nonlinear Schrodinger model of paraxial beam propagation in isotropic local media with saturable nonlinearity. Such ground states exist in the form of bright counterpropagating solitons. From the proof, a general threshold condition on the beam coupling constant for the existence of such fundamental solitons follows. "
"A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can do more than atomic imaging and manipulation. Its tunneling current can also be used for the excitation of light, converting electron energy to photon energy. STM based single-molecule electroluminescence can be realized by adopting a combined strategy of both efficient electronic decoupling and nanocavity plasmonic enhancement. The emission intensity, upon optimized material combination for the molecule, spacer, tip, and substrate, can be strong and stable enough for performing second-order photon correlation measurements. The observation of an evident photon antibunching effect demonstrates clearly the nature of single-photon emission for single-molecule electroluminescence. Strikingly, the spectral peak of a monomer is found to split when a molecular dimer is artificially constructed through STM manipulation, which suggests that the excitation energy from tunneling electrons is likely to rapidly delocalize over the whole molecular dimer. The spatial distribution of the excitonic coupling for different energy states in a dimer can be visualized in real space through sub-nanometer resolved electroluminescence imaging technique, which correlates very well with the local optical responses predicted in terms of coherent intermolecular dipole-dipole coupling. Furthermore, a single molecule can also couple coherently with a plasmonic nanocavity, resulting in the occurrence of interference-induced Fano resonance. These findings open up new avenues to fabricate electrically driven quantum light sources as well as to study intermolecular energy transfer, field-matter interaction, and molecular optoelectronics, all at the single-molecule level. "
"We investigate signatures of electronic correlations in the narrow-gap semiconductor FeGa$_3$ by means of electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements performed on single crystals of FeGa$_3$, Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Ga$_3$ and FeGa$_{3-y}$Zn$_y$, complemented by a study of the 4$d$ analog material RuGa$_3$. We find that the inclusion of sizable amounts of Mn and Zn dopants into FeGa$_3$ does not induce an insulator-to-metal transition. Our study indicates that both substitution of Zn onto the Ga site and replacement of Fe by Mn introduces states into the semiconducting gap that remain localized even at highest doping levels. Most importantly, using neutron powder diffraction measurements, we establish that FeGa$_3$ orders magnetically above room temperature in a complex structure, which is almost unaffected by the doping with Mn and Zn. Using realistic many-body calculations within the framework of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we argue that while the iron atoms in FeGa$_3$ are dominantly in an $S=1$ state, there are strong charge and spin fluctuations on short time scales, which are independent of temperature. Further, the low magnitude of local contributions to the spin susceptibility advocates an itinerant mechanism for the spin response in FeGa$_3$. Our joint experimental and theoretical investigations classify FeGa$_3$ as a correlated band insulator with only small dynamical correlation effects, in which non--local exchange interactions are responsible for the spin gap of 0.4 eV and the antiferromagnetic order. We show that hole doping of FeGa$_3$ leads, within DMFT, to a notable strengthening of many--body renormalizations. "
"We use weak gravitational lensing to analyse the dark matter halos around satellite galaxies in galaxy groups in the CFHTLenS dataset. This dataset is derived from the CFHTLS-Wide survey, and encompasses 154 sq. deg of high-quality shape data. Using the photometric redshifts, we divide the sample of lens galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^9 Msun to 10^10.5 Msun into those likely to lie in high-density environments (HDE) and those likely to lie in low-density environments (LDE). Through comparison with galaxy catalogues extracted from the Millennium Simulation, we show that the sample of HDE galaxies should primarily (~61%) consist of satellite galaxies in groups, while the sample of LDE galaxies should consist of mostly (~87%) non-satellite (field and central) galaxies. Comparing the lensing signals around samples of HDE and LDE galaxies matched in stellar mass, the lensing signal around HDE galaxies clearly shows a positive contribution from their host groups on their lensing signals at radii of ~500--1000 kpc, the typical separation between satellites and group centres. More importantly, the subhalos of HDE galaxies are less massive than those around LDE galaxies by a factor 0.65 +/- 0.12, significant at the 2.9 sigma level. A natural explanation is that the halos of satellite galaxies are stripped through tidal effects in the group environment. Our results are consistent with a typical tidal truncation radius of ~40 kpc. "
"Motivated by its practical success, we show that the two-dimensional total variation denoiser satisfies a sharp oracle inequality that leads to near optimal rates of estimation for a large class of image models such as bi-isotonic, H\""older smooth and cartoons. Our analysis hinges on properties of the unnormalized Laplacian of the two-dimensional grid such as eigenvector delocalization and spectral decay. We also present extensions to more than two dimensions as well as several other graphs. "
"Topological surgery in dimension $3$ is intrinsically connected with the classification of $3$-manifolds and with patterns of natural phenomena. In this expository paper, we present two different approaches for understanding and visualizing the process of $3$-dimensional surgery. In the first approach, we view the process in terms of its effect on the fundamental group. Namely, we present how $3$-dimensional surgery alters the fundamental group of the initial manifold and present ways to calculate the fundamental group of the resulting manifold. We also point out how the fundamental group can detect the topological complexity of non-trivial embeddings that produce knotting. The second approach can only be applied for standard embeddings. For such cases, we give new visualizations for both types of $3$-dimensional surgery as different rotations of the decompactified $2$-sphere. Each rotation produces a different decomposition of the $3$-sphere which corresponds to a different visualization of the $4$-dimensional process of $3$-dimensional surgery. "
"MD simulations of methane confined between graphite walls with up to 4,800,000 interaction sites, i.e., carbon atoms and methane molecules, are conducted, where the channel width is varied to include both the boundary-dominated regime and the transition to the continuum regime. This proves that MD can be used today to cover the entire range of characteristic lengths for which continuum methods fail. "
"Let $P_r(n)$ be the set of partitions of n with non negative rth differences. Let $\lambda$ be a partition chosen uniformly at random among the set $P_r(n)$. Let $d(\lambda)$ be a positive rth difference chosen uniformly at random in $\lambda$. The aim of this work is to show that for every $m\ge 1$, the probability that $d(\lambda)\ge m$ approaches $m^{-1/r}$ as $n\to\infty$. To prove this result we use bijective, asymptotic/analytic, and probabilistic combinatorics. "
"From the viewpoint of higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory, we introduce a new class of finite dimensional algebras of global dimension n, which we call n-representation infinite. They are a certain analog of representation infinite hereditary algebras, and we study three important classes of modules: n-preprojective, n-preinjective and n-regular modules. We observe that their homological behaviour is quite interesting. For instance they provide first examples of algebras having infinite Ext^1-orthogonal families of modules. Moreover we give general constructions of n-representation infinite algebras. Applying Minamoto's theory on Fano algebras in non-commutative algebraic geometry, we describe the category of n-regular modules in terms of the corresponding preprojective algebra. Then we introduce n-representation tame algebras, and show that the category of n-regular modules decomposes into the categories of finite dimensional modules over localizations of the preprojective algebra. This generalizes the classical description of regular modules over tame hereditary algebras. As an application, we show that the representation dimension of an n-representation tame algebra is at least n+2. "
"IEEE 802.11e standard defines two Medium Access Control (MAC) functions to support Quality of Service (QoS) for wireless local area networks: Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) and HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA). EDCA provides fair prioritized QoS support while HCCA guarantees parameterized QoS for the traffics with rigid QoS requirements. The latter shows higher QoS provisioning with Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffics. However, it does not efficiently cope with the fluctuation of the Variable Bit Rate (VBR) video streams since its reference scheduler generates a schedule based on the mean characteristics of the traffic. Scheduling based on theses characteristics is not always accurate as these tra_cs show high irregularity over the time. In this paper, we propose an enhancement on the HCCA polling mechanism to address the problem of scheduling pre-recorded VBR video streams. Our approach enhances the polling mechanism by feed-backing the arrival time of the subsequent video frame of the uplink traffic obtained through cross-layering approach. Simulation experiments have been conducted on several publicly available video traces in order to show the efficiency of our mechanism. The simulation results reveal the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in providing less delay and high throughput with conserving medium channel through minimizing the number of Null-Frames caused by wasted polls "
"We develop a general model of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) impedance with shielding provided by two parallel conducting plates. This model allows us to easily reproduce all previously known analytical CSR wakes and to expand the analysis to the situations not explored before. It reduces calculations of the impedance to taking integrals along the trajectory of the beam. New analytical results are derived for the radiation impedance with shielding for the following orbits: a kink, a bending magnet, a wiggler of finite length, and an infinitely long wiggler. All our formulas are benchmarked agains numerical simulations with the CSRZ computer code. "
"We study the Bose-Hubbard and Fermi-Hubbard model in the limit of large coordination numbers Z (i.e., many tunnelling partners). Via a controlled expansion into powers of 1/Z, we establish a hierarchy of correlations, which facilitates an approximate analytic solution of the quantum evolution. For the Bose-Hubbard model, we derive the growth of phase coherence after a quench from the Mott to the superfluid phase. For a quench within the Mott phase, we find that various local observables approach a quasi-equilibrium state after a finite period of time. However, this state is not thermal, i.e., real thermalisation -- if it occurs -- requires much longer time scales. For a tilted lattice in the Mott state, we calculate the tunnelling probability and find a remarkable analogy to the Sauter-Schwinger effect (i.e., electron-positron pair creation out of the vacuum due to a strong electric field). These analytical results are compared to numerical simulations for finite lattices in one and two dimensions and we find qualitative agreement. Finally, we generalize these studies to the more involved case of the Fermi-Hubbard model. "
"The phase diagrams of correlated systems like cuprates or pnictides high-temperature superconductors are characterized by a topological change of the Fermi surface under continuous variation of an external parameter, the so-called Lifshitz transition. However, the large number of low-temperature instabilities and the interplay of multiple energy scales complicate the study of this phenomenon. Here we first identify the optical signatures of a pressure-induced Lifshitz transition in a clean elemental system, black phosphorus. By applying external pressures above 1.5 GPa, we observe a change in the pressure dependence of the Drude plasma frequency due to the appearance of massless Dirac fermions. At higher pressures, optical signatures of two structural phase transitions are also identified. Our findings suggest that a key fingerprint of the Lifshitz transition in solid state systems, and in absence of structural phase transitions, is a discontinuity of the Drude plasma frequency due to the change of Fermi surface topology. "
"Berry connection is conventionally defined as a static gauge field in the Brillouin zone. Here we show that for three-dimensional (3d) time-reversal invariant superconductors, a generalized Berry gauge field behaves as a fluctuating field of a Chern-Simons gauge theory. The gapless nodal lines in the momentum space play the role of Wilson loop observables, while their linking and knot invariants modify the gravitational theta angle. This angle induces a topological gravitomagnetoelectric effect where a temperature gradient induces a rotational energy flow. We also show how topological strings may be realized in the 6 dimensional phase space, where the physical space defects play the role of topological D-branes. "
"This is the first of a series of papers. Our final goal is to establish Deligne-Riemann-Roch isomorphisms in various settings. In this paper, we establish a uniqueness theorem for Deligne pairings and prove the degree $1$ part of the Deligne-Riemann-Roch theorem. "
"We argue that some scenarios for the enigmatic supernova (SN) iPTF14hls and its progenitor require a strong binary interaction. We examine scenarios that attribute the extra power of iPTF14hls to a magnetar, to a late fallback on to the neutron star (NS) that launches jets, to an interaction of the ejecta with a circumstellar matter (CSM), or to a common envelope jets SN (CEJSN). For each of these four scenarios, we study the crucial process that supplies the extra energy and conclude that a binary companion to the progenitor must be present. For the magnetar scenario and late jets we claim that a companion should spin-up the pre-collapse core, in the ejecta-CSM scenario we find that the formation of the equatorial CSM requires a companion, and in the CEJSN where a NS spirals-in inside the giant envelope of the progenitor and launches jets the strong binary interaction is built-in. We argue that these types of strong binary interactions make the scenarios rare and explain the enigmatic nature of iPTF14hls. We further study processes that might accompany the binary interaction, in particular, the launching of jets before, during and after the explosion and their observational consequences. We do not consider the difficulties of the different scenarios and neither do we determine the best scenario for iPTF14hls. We rather focus on the binary nature of these scenarios that might as well explain other rare types of SNe. "
"We analyse the properties of the HI gas distribution in the Auriga project, a set of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO and a physics model for galaxy formation that succeeds in forming realistic late-type galaxies in the 30 Milky Way-sized haloes simulated in this project. We use a simple approach to estimate the neutral hydrogen fraction in our simulation set, which treats low-density and star-forming gas separately, and we explore two different prescriptions to subtract the contribution of molecular hydrogen from the total HI content. The HI gas in the vast majority of the systems forms extended discs although more disturbed morphologies are present. Notwithstanding the general good agreement with observed HI properties -- such as radial profiles and the mass-diameter relation -- the Auriga galaxies are systematically larger and more gas-rich than typical nearby galaxies. Interestingly, the amount of HI gas outside the disc plane correlates with the star formation rate, consistent with a picture where most of this extra-planar HI gas originates from a fountain-like flow. Our findings are robust with respect to the different assumptions adopted for computing the molecular hydrogen fraction and do not vary significantly over a wide range of numerical resolution. The HI modelling introduced in this paper can be used in future work to build artificial interferometric HI data cubes, allowing an even closer comparison of the gas dynamics in simulated galaxies with observations.

"We consider the strictly hyperbolic Cauchy problem \begin{align*} &D_t^m u - \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{m-1} \sum\limits_{|\gamma|+j = m} a_{m-j,\,\gamma}(t,\,x) D_x^\gamma D_t^j u = 0, \newline &D_t^{k-1}u(0,\,x) = g_k(x),\,k = 1,\,\ldots,\,m, \end{align*} for $(t,\,x) \in [0,\,T]\times \mathbb{R}^n$ with coefficients belonging to the Zygmund class $C^s_\ast$ in $x$ and having a modulus of continuity below Lipschitz in $t$. Imposing additional conditions to control oscillations, we obtain a global (on $[0,\,T]$) $L^2$ energy estimate without loss of derivatives for $s \geq \{1+\varepsilon,\,\frac{2m_0}{2-m_0}\}$, where $m_0$ is linked to the modulus of continuity of the coefficients in time. "
"Music is usually highly structured and it is still an open question how to design models which can successfully learn to recognize and represent musical structure. A fundamental problem is that structurally related patterns can have very distinct appearances, because the structural relationships are often based on transformations of musical material, like chromatic or diatonic transposition, inversion, retrograde, or rhythm change. In this preliminary work, we study the potential of two unsupervised learning techniques - Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Gated Autoencoders (GAEs) - to capture pre-defined transformations from constructed data pairs. We evaluate the models by using the learned representations as inputs in a discriminative task where for a given type of transformation (e.g. diatonic transposition), the specific relation between two musical patterns must be recognized (e.g. an upward transposition of diatonic steps). Furthermore, we measure the reconstruction error of models when reconstructing musical transformed patterns. Lastly, we test the models in an analogy-making task. We find that it is difficult to learn musical transformations with the RBM and that the GAE is much more adequate for this task, since it is able to learn representations of specific transformations that are largely content-invariant. We believe these results show that models such as GAEs may provide the basis for more encompassing music analysis systems, by endowing them with a better understanding of the structures underlying music.

All finite-dimensional Leibniz algebra bimodules of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ over a field of characteristic zero are described. 
"The new definition of the energy dependence for the level density parameter including collective effects depends strongly on the semi-classical approach. For this method, defining an accurate single-particle potential is of great importance. The effect of the single-particle potential terms, which are central, spin-orbit, harmonic oscillator, Woods-Saxon and Coulomb potential, both for spherical and deformed cases, on the level density parameter was investigated by examining the local success of the global parameterizations of eight different combinations of these terms. Among these combinations, the sum of the central, spin-orbit, harmonic oscillator and Coulomb potentials, gives the most accurate predictions compared with experimental data. The local selections of the global parameterizations show that the single-particle models, which are based on Woods-Saxon potential as the main term, are more suitable candidates than the models based on harmonic oscillator potential to extrapolate away far from stability. Also it can be concluded that the contribution of the Coulomb interaction, both around the closed and open shells is not neglectable. "
"We present an incentive-compatible polynomial-time approximation scheme for multi-unit auctions with general k-minded player valuations. The mechanism fully optimizes over an appropriately chosen sub-range of possible allocations and then uses VCG payments over this sub-range. We show that obtaining a fully polynomial-time incentive-compatible approximation scheme, at least using VCG payments, is NP-hard. For the case of valuations given by black boxes, we give a polynomial-time incentive-compatible 2-approximation mechanism and show that no better is possible, at least using VCG payments. "
"We prove localized energy estimates for the wave equation in domains with a strictly concave boundary when homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann conditions are imposed. By restricting the solution to small, frequency dependent, space time collars of the boundary, it is seen that a stronger gain in regularity can be obtained relative to the usual energy estimates. Mixed norm estimates of Strichartz and square function type follow as a result, using the energy estimates to control error terms which arise in a wave packet parametrix construction. While the latter estimates are not new for Dirichlet conditions, the present approach provides an avenue for treating these estimates when Neumann conditions are imposed. The method also treats Schr\""odinger equations with time independent coefficients. "
"We study the stability of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini (ST) black holes in fourth-order gravity which provides a higher dimensional linearized massive equation. The linearized-Ricci tensor perturbation is employed to exhibit unstable modes featuring the Gregory-Laflamme (GL) instability of higher dimensional black strings, in comparison to the stable ST black holes in Einstein gravity. It turns out that the GL instability of the ST black holes in the fourth-order gravity originates from the massiveness, but not a nature of fourth-order derivative theories giving ghost states. "
"We are interested to the multifractal analysis of inhomogeneous Bernoulli products which are also known as coin tossing measures. We give conditions ensuring the validity of the multifractal formalism for such measures. On another hand, we show that these measures can have a dense set of phase transitions. "
"We study the evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods games where, besides the classical strategies of cooperation (C) and defection (D), we consider punishing cooperators (PC) or punishing defectors (PD) as an additional strategy. Using a minimalist modeling approach, our goal is to separately clarify and identify the consequences of the two punishing strategies. Since punishment is costly, punishing strategies loose the evolutionary competition in case of well-mixed interactions. When spatial interactions are taken into account, however, the outcome can be strikingly different, and cooperation may spread. The underlying mechanism depends on the character of the punishment strategy. In case of cooperating punishers, increasing the fine results in a rising cooperation level. In contrast, in the presence of the PD strategy, the phase diagram exhibits a reentrant transition as the fine is increased. Accordingly, the level of cooperation shows a non-monotonous dependence on the fine. Remarkably, punishing strategies can spread in both cases, but based on largely different mechanisms, which depend on the cooperativeness (or not) of punishers. "
"Aboriginal Australians carefully observe the properties and positions of stars, including both overt and subtle changes in their brightness, for subsistence and social application. These observations are encoded in oral tradition. I examine two Aboriginal oral traditions from South Australia that describe the periodic changing brightness in three pulsating, red-giant variable stars: Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri), and Antares (Alpha Scorpii). The Australian Aboriginal accounts stand as the only known descriptions of pulsating variable stars in any Indigenous oral tradition in the world. Researchers examining these oral traditions over the last century, including anthropologists and astronomers, missed the description of these stars as being variable in nature as the ethnographic record contained several misidentifications of stars and celestial objects. Arguably, ethnographers working on Indigenous Knowledge Systems should have academic training in both the natural and social sciences. "
"We extend certain homomorphisms defined on the higher Torelli subgroups of the mapping class group to crossed homomorphisms defined on the entire mapping class group. In particular, for every $k\geq 2$, we construct a crossed homomorphism $\epsilon_k$ which extends Morita's homomorphism $\tilde \tau_k$ to the entire mapping class group. From this crossed homomorphism we also obtain a crossed homomorphism extending the $k$th Johnson homomorphism $\tau_k$ to the mapping class group. D. Johnson and S. Morita obtained their respective homomorphisms by considering the action of the mapping class group on the nilpotent truncations of the surface group; our approach is to mimic Morita's construction topologically by using nilmanifolds associated to these truncations. This allows us to take the ranges of these crossed homomorphisms to be certain finite-dimensional real vector spaces associated to these nilmanifolds. "
"We present a general approximation framework for weighted integer covering problems. In a weighted integer covering problem, the goal is to determine a non-negative integer solution $x$ to system $\{ Ax \geq r \}$ minimizing a non-negative cost function $c^T x$ (of appropriate dimensions). All coefficients in matrix $A$ are assumed to be non-negative. We analyze the performance of a very simple primal-dual greedy algorithm and discuss conditions of system $(A,r)$ that guarantee feasibility of the constructed solutions, and a bounded approximation factor. We call system $(A,r)$ a \emph{greedy system} if it satisfies certain properties introduced in this work. These properties highly rely on monotonicity and supermodularity conditions on $A$ and $r$, and can thus be seen as a far reaching generalization of contra-polymatroids. Given a greedy system $(A,r)$, we carefully construct a truncated system $(A',r)$ containing the same integer feasible points. We show that our primal-dual greedy algorithm when applied to the truncated system $(A',r)$ obtains a feasible solution to $(A,r)$ with approximation factor at most $2\delta + 1$, or $2\delta$ if $r$ is non-negative. Here, $\delta$ is some characteristic of the truncated matrix $A'$ which is small in many applications. The analysis is shown to be tight up to constant factors. We also provide an approximation factor of $k (\delta + 1)$ if the greedy algorithm is applied to the intersection of multiple greedy systems. The parameter $k$ is always bounded by the number of greedy systems but may be much smaller. Again, we show that the dependency on $k$ is tight. We conclude this paper with an exposition of classical approximation results based on primal-dual algorithms that are covered by our framework. We match all of the known results. Additionally, we provide some new insight in a generalization of the flow cover on a line problem. "
"We have discovered the pulsar associated with the supernova remnant G21.5-0.9. PSR J1833-1034, with spin period P = 61.8 ms and dispersion measure 169 pc/cc, is very faint, with pulse-averaged flux density of approximately 70 microJy at a frequency of 1.4 GHz, and was first detected in a deep search with the Parkes telescope. Subsequent observations with Parkes and the Green Bank Telescope have confirmed this detection, and yield a period derivative dP/dt = 2.02e-13. These spin parameters imply a characteristic age tau_c = 4.8 kyr and a spin-down luminosity dE/dt = 3.3e37 ergs/s, the latter value exceeded only by the Crab pulsar among the rotation-powered pulsars known in our Galaxy. The pulsar has an unusually steep radio spectrum in the 0.8-2.0 GHz range, with power law index ~3.0, and a narrow single-peaked pulse profile with full-width at half maximum of 0.04P. We have analyzed 350 ks of archival Chandra X-ray Observatory High Resolution Camera (HRC) data, and find a point-like source of luminosity approximately 3e-5dE/dt, offset from the center of an elliptical region of size ~7""x5"" and luminosity approximately 1e-3dE/dt within which likely lies the pulsar wind termination shock. We have searched for X-ray pulsations in a 30 ks HRC observation without success, deriving a pulsed fraction upper limit for a sinusoidal pulse shape of about 70% of the pulsar flux. We revisit the distance to G21.5-0.9 based on HI and CO observations, arguing that it is 4.7+-0.4 kpc. We use existing X-ray and radio observations of the pulsar wind nebula, along with the measured properties of its engine and a recent detection of the supernova remnant shell, to argue that G21.5-0.9 and PSR J1833-1034 are much younger than tau_c, and likely their true age is ~<1000 yr. In that case, the initial spin period of the pulsar was >~55 ms. "
"Recent work by Ishibashi, Maeda, and Mefford shows that the validity of the QNEC is sensitive to the IR regulator that one uses to define the entropy and its variations. In this note we discuss two general options that preserve both the QNEC and a physically-sensible notion of entropy density. We illustrate the application of each through an example. An important guiding principle is that an IR regulator should have a physical interpretation. "
"Active particles driven by colored noise can be approximately mapped onto a system that obeys detailed balance. The effective interactions which can be derived for such a system allow to describe the structure and phase behavior of the active fluid by means of an effective free energy. In this paper we explain why the related thermodynamic results for pressure and interfacial tension do not represent the results one would measure mechanically. We derive a dynamical density functional theory, which in the steady state simultaneously validates the use of effective interactions and provides access to mechanical quantities. Our calculations suggest that in the colored-noise model the mechanical pressure in coexisting phases might be unequal and the interfacial tension can become negative. "
"We present a novel approach to automatically segment magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human brain into anatomical regions. Our methodology is based on a deep artificial neural network that assigns each voxel in an MR image of the brain to its corresponding anatomical region. The inputs of the network capture information at different scales around the voxel of interest: 3D and orthogonal 2D intensity patches capture the local spatial context while large, compressed 2D orthogonal patches and distances to the regional centroids enforce global spatial consistency. Contrary to commonly used segmentation methods, our technique does not require any non-linear registration of the MR images. To benchmark our model, we used the dataset provided for the MICCAI 2012 challenge on multi-atlas labelling, which consists of 35 manually segmented MR images of the brain. We obtained competitive results (mean dice coefficient 0.725, error rate 0.163) showing the potential of our approach. To our knowledge, our technique is the first to tackle the anatomical segmentation of the whole brain using deep neural networks. "
"In this paper we present a deep-learning model that competed at SemEval-2018 Task 2 ""Multilingual Emoji Prediction"". We participated in subtask A, in which we are called to predict the most likely associated emoji in English tweets. The proposed architecture relies on a Long Short-Term Memory network, augmented with an attention mechanism, that conditions the weight of each word, on a ""context vector"" which is taken as the aggregation of a tweet's meaning. Moreover, we initialize the embedding layer of our model, with word2vec word embeddings, pretrained on a dataset of 550 million English tweets. Finally, our model does not rely on hand-crafted features or lexicons and is trained end-to-end with back-propagation. We ranked 2nd out of 48 teams. "
"With the emerging big data applications of Machine Learning, Speech Recognition, Artificial Intelligence, and DNA Sequencing in recent years, computer architecture research communities are facing the explosive scale of various data explosion. To achieve high efficiency of data-intensive computing, studies of heterogeneous accelerators which focus on latest applications, have become a hot issue in computer architecture domain. At present, the implementation of heterogeneous accelerators mainly relies on heterogeneous computing units such as Application-specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Among the typical heterogeneous architectures above, FPGA-based reconfigurable accelerators have two merits as follows: First, FPGA architecture contains a large number of reconfigurable circuits, which satisfy requirements of high performance and low power consumption when specific applications are running. Second, the reconfigurable architectures of employing FPGA performs prototype systems rapidly and features excellent customizability and reconfigurability. Nowadays, in top-tier conferences of computer architecture, emerging a batch of accelerating works based on FPGA or other reconfigurable architectures. To better review the related work of reconfigurable computing accelerators recently, this survey reserves latest high-level research products of reconfigurable accelerator architectures and algorithm applications as the basis. In this survey, we compare hot research issues and concern domains, furthermore, analyze and illuminate advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of reconfigurable accelerators. In the end, we prospect the development tendency of accelerator architectures in the future, hoping to provide a reference for computer architecture researchers. "
"Let F(R^n) be the algebra of Fourier transforms of functions from L_1(R^n), K(R^n) be the algebra of Fourier transforms of bounded complex Borel measures in R^n and W be Wiener algebra of continuous 2pi-periodic functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series. New properties of functions from these algebras are obtained. Some conditions which determine membership of f in F(R) are given. For many elementary functions f the problem of belonging f to F(R) can be resolved easily using these conditions. We prove that the Hilbert operator is a bijective isometric operator in the Banach spaces W_0, F(R), K(R)-A_1 (A_1 is the one-dimension space of constant functions). We also consider the classes M_k, which are similar to the Bochner classes F_k, and obtain integral representation of the Carleman transform of measures of M_k by integrals of some specific form. "
"Let $F$ be a field and let $F^{r\times s}$ denote the space of $r\times s$ matrices over $F$. Given equinumerous subsets $\mathcal{A}=\{A_i\mid i \in I\}\subseteq F^{r\times r}$ and $\mathcal{B}=\{B_i\mid i\in I\}\subseteq F^{s\times s}$ we call the subspace $C(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}):=\{X\in F^{r\times s}\mid A_iX=XB_i\ {\rm for }\ i\in I\}$ an \emph{intertwining code}. We show that if $C(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})\ne\{0\}$, then for each $i\in I$, the characteristic polynomials of $A_i$ and $B_i$ and share a nontrivial factor. We give an exact formula for $k=\dim(C(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}))$ and give upper and lower bounds. This generalizes previous work in this area. Finally we construct intertwining codes with large minimum distance when the field is not `too small'. We give examples of codes where $d=rs/k=1/R$ is large where the minimum distance, dimension, and rate of the linear code $C(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ by $d$, $k$, and $R=k/rs$, respectively. "
"The probability distribution function (PDF) of the ground-state energy in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model is numerically determined by collecting a large statistical sample of ground states, computed using a genetic algorithm. It is shown that the standard deviation of the ground-state energy per spin scales with the number of spins, N, as N^{-\rho} with \rho \simeq 0.765, but the value \rho=3/4 is also compatible with the data, while the previously proposed value \rho=5/6 is ruled out. The PDF satisfies finite-size scaling with a non-Gaussian asymptotic PDF, which can be fitted remarkably well by the Gumbel distribution for the m-th smallest element in a set of random variables, with m \simeq 6.
