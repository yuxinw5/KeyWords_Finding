# KeyWords_Finding
A research project with Professor Kevin Chang

# Goal
Given a keyword (e.g “deep learning”), find documents (abstracts) that contain the keyword in that year

# Steps
1. Download ArXiv computer science paper abstracts from https://www.kaggle.com/tayorm/arxiv-papers-metadata/version/1#arxiv-abstracts-all.txt.
2. Build a search service, using Python Whoosh, given a keyword (e.g.,”linear regression” or “deep learning”), find documents (abstracts) that contain the keyword in that year.
3. Create a simple web interface to demo the search— input keywords, return a ranked list of snippets of keyword occurrences.

# Run
1. Create a folder that contains all these files
2. Open command prompt to the New folder directory, type python demo1.py to run the script
3. Go to browser type localhost:5000, then you will see button
